TikTok is a much-needed addition to my hectic life and offers so much more than other social media apps! Five HUGE Stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Someone created an account just to bully me. I reported it and TikTok did nothing about it. I’m not sure this app is as friendly as I first thought. Maybe this is how it is supposed to be, but if what happened to me happens to someone else not as strong as I am, I could see them hurting themselves or someone else. Is that what you want?? Other creators are trying to find me and there are several accounts with the same name. At least ONE that is imitating my account. I wish to be verified. Many accounts have the same name as me. Mine @ name is trademarked. I am considered a “celebrity” in my industry. Thank You!!! Still having challenges with people finding my account (me). Please verify my account.

       "  'review': 'Honestly tiktok  is a great app but is overall very addicting I feel like the preview of the app looks very nice but once you download the app it takes over daily task and makes them harder. \\nI love being able to share videos and watch tons of people’s creations, but compared to what the preview tells you the app is very different you get banned for small things and have your videos taken down but there’s nudity all over  tiktok that has yet to be taken down, I get it’s just a body but kids shouldn’t have to experience such things like that yet there are also very rude people and they shouldn’t have to be bullied either. Also  tiktok  can honestly take over small easy task like cleaning  it’s honestly very addicting and all you do after you delete it is download it back, Some people aren’t able to small task as easily as others and tiktok just makes that harder for them like lack of motivation is a real struggle and staying up all night isn’t something that helps. When you reach  10k+ you get creator funds but honestly you don’t get that much money I get it’s a 1-2 minute video but lots of influencers and artist etc work hard on a lot of those videos just to get like 16$ on a video. \\nAnd I’m not trying to blame the app creators it’s basically the people on the app but this is just the stuff that happens on the app and needs to be banned and the creators need to start getting more money than what they actually get.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Instead of having only a few users get updates at a time and doing rollouts, I feel like everyone should get the updates at the same time. I still haven’t gotten the option to repost videos or create playlists while some of my friends have. But then they also have the issue where I’m able to upload the 3 and 10 minutes videos and create stories but they haven’t gotten those updates yet. I also feel like we should be able to schedule our posts on the app. I know we’re able to do it on the desktop but most of us use the app on our phones so it doesn’t make sense that we wouldn’t be able to have that option. On tumblr we’re able to put our posts in a queue or schedule them to be released at a specific time. If we had that option it would make it easier to make posts consistently without us having to worry about timing.\\n\\nI really enjoy the new Studio that’s been implemented, however I believe a major flaw in it is that when we decide to edit a clip and start over is that we can’t hear the section of audio of said clip while re-recording. Before Studio we had that option automatically applied so when we record something again, we can make sure the timing is right, especially if we’re lip syncing. Now we can’t hear anything while recording again so we have to hope for the best or just start the entire video over from scratch.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I really enjoy this social media platform. The app is amazing and a great way to socialize with people all around the world. it’s all wonderful. What I do have a problem with is how quick this app can take down a harmless video. And yet the traumatizing video of a dog being ripped to shreds in broad daylight seemed like it took forever to be taken off. I remember getting one of my videos taken down because it had one swearword in it. It got taken down a day after I posted it. But it took groups of people to make videos under the sound for the video to get taken off of tiktok. A lot of people complained about being disturbed after seeing the video. I mean how could you not? It was nothing but sick. I won’t going to detail about it. This isn’t the first issue either. It took a good week for a A video with a edited audio from the game. The person who made it made it seem like the child was having sex with a character that was supposedly known as an adult. Either way that doesn’t make it OK. They even made two videos just with a different character. There’s even an account still up today where there’re making animation videos about the child and the character dating. All I’m saying is I love this app. I’ve gained a lot of confidence from it and I’m happy with my account. I just think tiktok needs to be a little bit quicker and concerned about the gruesome videos and disgusting ones uploaded.',\n",

It seems they do it when you begin to grow fast all of a sudden you began to slow down and I feel they put your videos out when they want to. I’m self employed, I have a son graduating this year,I’m writing a book and looking to relocate so I can’t put videos out at a certain time or stay current on the trends but my videos should be pushed as well. I have a video that was my first 1.5 views and when it got there TikTok muted it. Why? When I can’t post new content I will repost an old video to try and keep my followers. The other videos haven’t been muted but they muted the growing ones. This has happened so much at first I almost gave up but because of the people on here, I stayed. I don’t feel I’ll ever go viral but honestly once I can give more I will however when I was giving my videos was being muted and continued to get violations. I’ve had to constantly appeal things in the beginning. Like I said I love the people on TikTok don’t know how happy I am with the people who get paid to watch our videos and get paid. They want you to pay to get boosted but I want to earn my followers and likes. I did this to help with my mental and at first it began to effect it when you’re trying so hard but kept getting muted but now I’m learning.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Writing this review I feel bad giving only 3 stars, considering I’m literally obsessed with this app, but there are some major problems (in my opinion) with it. First of all, the app is addicting. I’ve lost so many hours watching TikTok that I could’ve been studying, sleeping, etcetera. I know it’s partially my fault, but I still think more can be done to prevent users from staying on the app for long periods of time. The second thing is about updates. I have multiple TikTok accounts. Every account has a different version of updates. I am also always behind on new updates because of this. When I go on the app store most of the time it reads “open” instead of “update”. I’m very frustrated when I can’t participate in trends because I’m still stuck with a version that is 2 months behind all of my friends. I understand the app isn’t perfect but if there’s an update it should be available to all users at the same time. I know that my phone isn’t the problem, as other users have experienced the same thing as me. Other than this and the fact that I can’t stay off of it, TikTok is a great app and sometimes can be very uplifting and kind. The app allows you to express your creativity and learn to do things you would’ve never thought you would need to know. I believe if these two things could be improved, then TikTok will be the perfect app for people to use as a way to get involved and be their true selves.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I’ve been on TikTok since 2019 and it has its ups and downs. I had a some videos go viral which is pretty cool, but the algorithm is so unpredictable sometimes that most of my content is barely seen even with the use of trends and huge amounts of effort. My biggest complaint though is how broken the moderation system is. It’s unusually strict and even unpredictable. Even when I follow guidelines I still get content taken down, which is confusing and frustrating. On other platforms such as Twitter, Insta, etc., I have never gotten any of my content taken down or flagged ever. I’ve had several TikToks taken down for unknown reasons and the reasons listed are usually vague or wildly incorrect. For example, I used a fake animal prop and it was taken down for “violence” even though I made a disclaimer in the video stating it was a prop and no actual animals were harmed. Despite this, my appeal got rejected so I emailed customer service, which itself is a whole other headache to deal with. It took them WEEKS to respond and all they did was give me a generic response to click the appeal link, which I already told them that I did. It’s as if they didn’t read the actual email at all. Overall, I feel like I have to walk on eggshells now when I post content. It takes the joy out of it. TikTok, if you’re actually reading this, PLEASE fix this.

       "  'review': 'For all of the hype that surrounds TikTok, it is an incredibly interesting app that plays a major role in the life of most adolescents today. It can create unique spaces of community on the app, and provide content for people to talk about, share, and bond over outside the app itself. However, from my own experience, I would rate the app a 3 out of 5. The fact that the For You page provides a constant stream of new content is a brilliant design choice to get people to spend longer on the app, it can often feel like the user does not have agency over what they are seeing. Additionally, fears about being on a different ‘side’ of TikTok than peers could be a source of stress or concern for some adolescents, adding to potential mental health effects social media can have. Most of the design of the app is intuitive once the user has been on it for a little bit, and while the privacy settings are not front-and-center, they are available so that adolescents can have the content that they view tailored somewhat to not include inappropriate content and to promote healthy app usage, but allowing a parent to have potential control over being able to extend time using the app must feel like an invasion of their privacy. However, without an external source of monitoring, it can be very easy for adolescents, as well as adults, to become compulsive TikTok users who only find sporadic joy from the content they watch.',\n",

There are some videos that aren’t appropriate for kids under the age of 11, but in order to fix this, you can restrict time limits and what videos they can see. If your kid is super addicted to tiktok, or is on the app 24/7, deleting the app or account is not the solution. This has happened to me once, on accident. I thought tiktok was deleted and I was really sad because tiktok was my favorite  app and I watched it a lot and made many videos on my account. Parents, don’t delete their accounts or apps. Don’t go farther then that. If you go on tiktok settings, you can set time limits and restrictions and you can set it to where your kid can see videos appropriate for THEIR age. Don’t scroll through your kids phone, even I they look worried or guilty that your scrolling on it, they are not always doing something bad in it or inappropriate things. Sometimes they are just nervous you’ll delete the app or account, or lose their online friendships. You can also download tiktok so you can see what your kid posts, and gain them a new follower ! Anyway, the tiktok app is amazing and you can make many friends on this app and express your feelings and post about your life, or maybe gaming! Overall, I love tiktok and this app is amazing!',\n",

       "  'review': 'Okay, here’s my review. This APP IS WONDERFUL. But there are some down sides to it. So, I deleted this app once but I wanted it back so I can use it on my spare time. So I just got it back and apparently I can’t get back into my old account. I saved all the data but the password doesn’t work. I’ve tried a bunch of times. It’s probably a bug. Anyways, my second “but” is that even if you don’t want an account and your trust trying out the app, don’t pull up the pop-up that says “SIGN UP” or “LOGIN IN”. I honestly don’t want an account for many reasons. Bullying, mean comments, inappropriate things, ext. At this time-period, you don’t have anywhere to be, or anything to do besides hang with your roommates (roommate), family members, or yourself. Trust me, it’s tough. But at this point social-media is our life now to figure out things and to learn more. (This probably has nothing to do but I’m trying to give ideas and my opinions). Sometimes I try to not open this app up because I don’t want to see the pop-up where it says to “SIGN IN” or to “LOGIN IN”. Please don’t get me wrong but this app is incredible because I use it on other devices. But this device I use daily needs this app! Thanks for letting me share my review. Hope it’s well enough for ideas. Stay safe! Happy Holidays!!!\\n\\n-Your fellow TikTok Fan.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I love TikTok; it is one of my favorite apps. However, TikTok randomly asked me to confirm my age, for some reason (which wouldn’t normally bother me because I had already confirmed it before),  so I confirmed my age. I put in my real date of birth (I’m 13 years old) and TikTok made my account private, made it to where people are unable to duet, stitch, or download my videos, and I can neither send nor receive messages. I completely understand that TikTok doesn’t want young children to get access to the app and post videos with their face or make unintelligent choices, but I have not done anything against TikTok’s policies or spread any negative energy. I am unable to send videos and messages to my friends or receive videos and messages from my friends. This has also happened to one of my old friends; someone reported him for being under the age limit (he is 13 years old) and TikTok private’s his account. I completely understand if you want people who are 13 years of age or younger to have privacy and not share personal information, but it doesn’t make sense that there are only some people (around 13 years old) that are being forced to have their accounts private’s when others do not also have to go through this.

If you own the right to audio material and it is flagged as copy written by mistake the audio will be removed and appealing the decision usually does not result in the mistake being corrected. Terms of service are often violated due to inexplicable mistakes on behalf of whatever algorithm TikTok uses to filter content. The app has a problem with illegal content that is harmful to minors surfacing and being widely shared before it is reported and taken down. There is a problem with the algorithm favoring White content creators over Black content creators. When you report racist material that targets African Americans it is usually not removed or addressed but if you make a video addressing aforementioned racist content as an African American content creator your response is often taken down due to violating the exact terms of service you are trying to bring attention to. Overall the app has potential but the racism on the platform and content that is dangerous to minors means that users need to be monitored by parents or guardians if they are not adults. Hopefully there will be a similar app with a much better algorithm that will surface in the near future and replace this one making TikTok obsolete.',\n",

The reason they banned me was far from the truth as I do not drink and I do not smoke and I do not have any artillery. It seems that you were guilty until proven innocent and they really don’t respond to you whenever you submit anything to support and asked to know why or what happened so you know what it was. People can have a vendetta against you or they can feel threatened and then just report you and then you’re just shut down. This happened to me two Sundays ago and then it was removed and seeing that nothing was done on my part and then sure enough another week rolls around and on another Sunday the same thing happened and now it has taken days on the appeal. There needs to be a better process and I don’t think that it’s fair. I do think that TikTok is an excellent platform but they really need to work on customer service and personal interaction. I do agree with one review that I saw on here, where they said that they believe that if they don’t like you for whatever reason whether it is personal parents or whether you’re able to entertain the executives; or whether you’re able to bring in money, then this happens quite often until you are completely banned forever.

This would also help content creators as well because it would allow their content to be seen more. We are all struggling in this pandemic and I feel this would be a great help for smaller creators in the creator fund. Another problem is how you enforce your rules. I’ve seen countless high follower count, young, fit women showing off more than what should be shown, as there are children on this app, while smaller creators are having their videos taken down with showing less than what the more popular creators are showing off. It is completely unfair and unjust. On one of the pages I follow, one of their videos was taken down for nudity, with showing an appropriate one-piece swimsuit, while there are other videos with much more shown off are still up.

For example sometimes the audio just starts glitching and sounding staticky if you’re recording a video. Another thing is that recently my videos have been delayed after i post them. So i would assume it’s airpods delay however all my videos are delayed now and that’s including ones i posted months ago. Also there are a few things that could make the app better like, when you stitch a video instead of the audio not carrying over, you can have a choice on whether you want to continue it or not. I feel that it would be more efficient and a lot easier if you want to finish an old transition you posted or anything else you might need. I also personally liked the old drafts layout, but it’s fine as is. Another problem is when you’re watching a video and a text or something may be covered by a profile or the caption or anything else on the side, it’s hard to see or read anything so I feel there should be a feature where you can swipe to the left and all those buttons would go away sort of like how it is on a live stream.

I’ve always thought of the app as very easy to use and accessible to all people (especially with the captions added to the app), but the new update that caused the drafts button to shrink has been a big problem to many creators. People are fond of their privacy, yet they still love the idea of making videos. This leads to many creators making little cringy videos that they would then just save to their drafts to post later or to just save the sound. Many have that muscle memory of just automatically clicking the middle of the drafts button, but because of this new update, they have been accidentally posting their drafts. Not only is this a nuisance to mentally check every time that you are not posting a draft, but it can be very compromising to creators who need videos to be only saved in their drafts, away from their followers.

Where it says drafts, there is just one button, and that’s to add the video to your drafts. I have looked up videos on where it is, because I guess I just don’t have one. I have put a lot of work into making tik toks, but I can’t even post them. Please at least tell me why this is happening, or if I’m just being dumb, tell me. Second of all, whenever I try to search ANYTHING, literally anything, it says “sorry this feature is currently unavailable” and I can’t search up anything AT ALL! It’s just super anoying, again just tell me if I’m being dumb, but I don’t think I am. Also it’s the same thing for writing comments :/ Third of all, I DONT HAVE A “FOR YOU” PAGE!!! I enjoy watching tik toks that are related to the ones that I already enjoy. But I still, have looked through the entire app, but I don’t have a for you page. Please try and fix these issues, because I think that they ruin almost the entire experience for me. \\n\\n              (Also I have an iPhone 6s so if that’s something that effects the way that the app works, sorry about that, but I mean idk)',\n",

However, I feel like there is more that TikTok could do to improve the app. For example, you should be able to see who duets a video. I feel like it would be easier if we want to see other people’s reactions and want to share that as well. I also feel like we should be able to have a story that is up for 24 hours so we don’t have to make videos about something we want to share that is really not that important. In addition to that, we should be able to repost videos on our story as well. I saw a really REALLY good danganronpa edit and it was SUPER underrated but I couldn’t share it with anyone because when I duetted it, it only got 2 views in a day. Also, I think we should be able to go live (like a FaceTime on live) with other people. It would be super fun! We used to have a feature where we could pin comments, but we can’t do that anymore? Which is kind of disappointing, but if you can do that again, it would be great! We should also be able to pin videos incase someone is new to an account and people want to introduce themselves. \\n\\nAnyway, I think that’s about all I wanted to share to help TikTok grow as a community and app.',\n",

On top of that, if you make the mistake of opening the newer friends tab, it just switches between an “add contacts” pop up and a “your friends are on TikTok” pop up. There’s no way to exit out of it fully and you can’t even just go back to one of the other tabs, you have to fully exit the app which, again, almost always completely resets everything for no apparent reason. A lot of these issues are recent, but for the love of god please fix them because right now the app is borderline unusable.\\n\\nAlso the way it treats its creators with recent content violation rules is absolutely awful and tends to target already suppressed voices. I’ve seen countless completely fine videos be stripped because of the auto-report system, it’s a major issue. In general, there needs to be less content suppression for having more controversial themes, especially since the app markets itself as a way to stay up to date.

If you are a parent figuring out if your child should be able to get TikTok just know that some songs and some dances are a little inappropriate for the younger kids. If your child is 11+ I would say they will be fine. The app itself is organized very well, so you save videos and sounds to look at later. You are allowed to have a private or public account depending where n your comfort. A private account means that you have to send a request to follow the user. This also means that you have to follow the user in order to watch their videos. Having a public account means anybody can follow you and anybody can sit and scroll through your account. You can remove followers. When having a public account, your videos may also be on the for you page. The for you page is videos you can scroll through of content that is recommended for you based on what you like and save. This is how many videos go viral. So an overall rating on this app, 10/10 would recommended, it keeps you busy all day and there is a video out there that will make you laugh.'},\n",

Better than other apps, TikTok asks what you like then shows it on your fyp, you can also customize what creators and specific content is on your fyp by liking videos and following creators.  There are fun trends to follow, with cool filters as well! You can have 8 accounts in total and they won’t be connected to the others, (so if you want a secret account, no one will find you). You can favorite sounds and videos, comments, etc.    That was Tiktoks good features!      Now for the not so great ones. These are the reason TikTok got a 4/5 from me.        So, TikTok has something called community guidelines, to keep every young child on the app safe and just cyber bullying under control in general, but the thing is, these guidelines are commonly false. For example, I got banned on a account with over 1000 followers for bullying even though I was duetting myself saying I was improving. And dumb things get removed on TikTok, such as videos, accounts, and comments. But then there are some cases where someone is doing something so wrong and it doesn’t even get removed until it gets over 1000 reports. That’s messed up. Other than that, tiktok is a great place! I recommend it! Just watch out for those guidelines! 😬👍'},\n",

Not only this they will make up bogus violations against certain people that are not even real violations of terms or guidelines. For example they will ban accounts of people just for eating. And worse than that they don’t always review stuff and when they do it’s just personal opinion on their part if they like it or not. Also they will suppress content creators like cosplayers or just ban their accounts all together for no reason. They also claim to have rules and stuff against bullying and harassment yet instead when someone comes to them about being bullied or harassed TikTok will punish the person being bullied by suppressing their account and making it so their videos don’t get seen as much rather than dealing with the actual bully, and they also will do this same suppression and content hiding on people who they don’t find attractive, people with disabilities, and people who they think are overweight. Some people don’t have these problems because TikTok just picks and chooses who to cause problems for. The list of problems goes on and on. People need to be aware that TikTok is a horrible app and is not user friendly to certain people just because it doesn’t like them. These problems need to be made public and need to be fixed.'},\n",

I had that account since 2017 and it got taken away. I have spammed Tiktok through Instagram DM’s they answered but never gave me my account back. I’m starting to think my account isn’t enough. Tiktok, I also found out ur banning more black people than white, hispanic,Mexican,and mixed people. It came across when I went to pages that were black and it said it was banned for Violating the community guidelines. You also have been taking down a lot of videos of mine when I am in swimsuits. Yet there are girl that are on a two piece bikini twerking. In my opinion, this app is not fair but it is a great way to bring people together and make alot of new friends.

I love inspiring kids, I love being looked at as a role model. The only reason it’s not a 5, is because of some safety issues. In the most respectful way, there’s been graphic content uploaded as videos, profile pics, or some even use this platform as a second option to a really bad mannered behavior. It’s scary for younger kids, or any one really but mainly for the kids. TikTok though has done ways to help prevent these things by making their guidelines more stricter and undergoing huge movements like the profile picture incident. Which is good of them. Tiktok is quick to react, let’s make this app safe! They are being more safer! This app should be kid friendly as well or friendly to anyone really! This new upcoming generation could be at risk if a huge used platform is letting these things out there. Yes I know it’s a worldwide use and not every little thing would be fix!

As a content creator, it’s been a bit different.  I’m enjoying the success I’ve had in the short amount of time since I created my account, but I gotta say the auto-moderation is just awful. Nobody should ever have a ban enacted on them or a video automatically removed just because the mod AI picked up a no-no word without context, or because people who simply don’t like the content reported it instead of scrolling. And there’s no real way to talk to a human being if you’d like to discuss issues like this. I’d love to have actual humans deciding what happens to my content and my account. And I’d love the option to speak to an actual human when I need to hash out account-related issues. I mean, I like being here so I bend over backwards to try and meet community standards while still retaining the humor that brought followers to my account in the first place. But these auto-disciplinary things still happen, often for no really good reason, and that is super frustrating. Otherwise, it’s a really fun app and I like it. Obviously I’m still around.

I think that you should be able to report someone and they would not be able to go on with doing the same thing they did, though thankfully- more than one person has to report the user, but indeed I have an idea you could add! The person should be active on their account at least 3 days so the same person does not report them with different accounts they are making. I suggest this app for many people that should be at least 10, basically double digits due to multiple swears that are allowed on this app. Maybe more edit options like, example; Camera swinging from on direction to the original video. This app is definitely absolutely perfect for people who enjoy making videos for others to see and enjoy! Though maybe make accounts get to the for you page more since its uncommon people search up a hashtag and find your video. Though I absolutely can’t stand this app, it’s amazing! And for another suggestion you should definitely add, make notifications for people messaging you and not allow spam if that is already added to the app, I suggest this app for you if you are looking forward to getting it!

It cover everything except her stomach. My video got banned even though charli and Addison and other famous girl tik tokers were short shorts and bikinis. I thought okay well I guess that’s okay to get banned. So I kept posting and everything was fine. At that point only one of my videos got banned. I hadn’t posted in a couple days so I decided to post a video of the song “Thank you next”, by Ariana grande, org pictured of horses at the barn I ride at. Just the horses themselves and at the end I put a picture of me and another horse. It was a selfie and you could see a lot of the horses face but a little bit of mine. It got banned and said I was permanently banned from my account. For no reason it should be banned. I was wearing normal clothes and you could only see my face. I have no clue why it got banned and I’m really upset because that was a really good account and every school friend I had and or friend followed me and I got a decent amount of likes on each video. I’m am really mad at TikTok right now. Like did the horse not wear enough clothes. Seriously...'},\n",

       "  'review': 'TikTok has easily become the most prolific social media app among all different demographics ranging from prepubescent to geriatric. It’s a wonderful platform to learn new information that is engaging and can even teach you new skills. I love that about this app but the one thing that I cannot and will not ever go along with is their censorship protocols and how their algorithm is trained to be extremely sensitive to look for keywords, phrases, names and places. TikTok will flag your video and remove it for a “community guidelines violation“, however, they failed to tell you which community guideline you have “violated“. Within the past year, TT updated their T&C to include a specific “community guideline“ that you “violated“. For a couple of months it was being implemented but now it has gone back to just a notification that your video was removed and one option to press one button, “appeal“. You cannot write or attach any supporting documents when appealing a video that supposedly “violated“ their community guidelines. Having easy access to information from all around the world is what average every day citizens want but that is not beneficial for the mainstream media so censorship is the “go to”. TikTok has a lot to work on regarding censorship even though they are a Chinese owned app.'},\n",

But ever since like May 2021 the app\\'s been doing some strange things like out of nowhere people are getting their MAIN accounts with like over 10K followers banned cause of some troll accounts. Also the app has been banning people off the LIVE access because they disobeyed the community guidelines like not being able to go LIVE because they\\'re 15 and younger (In order to go live apparently is 16 with a license). Most of the app\\'s community is 15 and younger and the app is letting all these sexual and violent people go live and then I go on the app some of the people I see going live are like 7 year old kids playing fortnite and is getting spat on by their viewers for the game they play \"it\\'s not the person it\\'s the game\". Also like last week out of nowhere I\\'ve been seeing people make meme videos about the drafts button being smaller than the post button, and me trying to avoid the update actually gets the update without manually doing it. I don\\'t see the point in that and I don\\'t know if the app wants to think that it\\'s a good thing. No it\\'s pushing buttons towards other creators that think the video they just recorded wasn\\'t good so they have to draft it. Now I wish TikTok was banned in the U.S. one update I do have to give them though is the skip video option. anyways that\\'s all I wanted to blabber about.'},\n",

I did cancel the member ship as soon as I found out about, I don’t even know if the pen will look like it did in the picture I saw. I’m just mad about the fact that TikTok let that ad on there website probably knowing that it was a scam, there had been a video posted 3 days after I saw the ad explaining that’s it’s a scam. I know TikTok may have not seen it yet but it still bugs me that TikTok could have prevented this scam and they didn’t. There are other ads similar to the one I clicked on, and those have been on there for awhile. If they are scams why isn’t TikTok doing anything about it, why are they ignoring this, what is wrong with them if they are ignoring it. I just don’t want to fall for anymore scams or have anyone else fall for. I hope TikTok just thoroughly check ads and their websites to make sure they are not scams before allowing them on the app, but I kinda doubt that they would do anything about this. Other then this I quite like enjoy the app, so I wouldn’t think trust most of the ads on TikTok anymore. There are some you can trust, but other then that don’t trust them yet.'},\n",

These features really bring down the experience for me. For one, Every other video is in another language. I’ve checked and redone my language settings, and I’ve clicked “not interested” for every one. I’m still somehow on Russian tok or Arabic. Another small thing is the favorites tab. All your favorited videos are in the same place with one problem. You can favorite thousands and have no way of finding that one video from a couple weeks ago. The app desperately needs organization. Favorites should have a sorting feature to group videos manually. That’s a feature I’ve been praying for over the last few years. An odd thing tiktok does is review the videos you post to “only visible to me” and deletes them. It isnt right to go through personal videos not meant for the public eye. Of course I don’t mean people post explicit or inappropriate videos there, but just like drafts, as long as the video is private like that, it shouldnt be reviewed by tiktok. There’s plenty more I could list off, but i believe those are the ones that bother me the most.

And in the case of the family at home during quarantine, TikTok made a way for families to grow closer, engage in fun challenges and videos together. To learn more about each other, grow deeper connections and have fun together. Also, this app has helped people feeling down, alone, and possibly having self harm ideation, to find comfort in other on the platform. To find others who have felt or feel the same way. TikTok gives opportunities to those to find support or comfort or laughter in what it is they are seeking. I believe TikTok is amazing. I just began using a few weeks ago and I am amazed.

There is so much you can do on tiktok, and it’s actually very easy to get famous compared to other social media’s, because everyone has equal opportunities. Aside from that, when tiktok says trends start here, I used to just roll my eyes, but now I literally see that around 80% of the trends I see are based on tiktok. Anything can go viral there in less than an hour. About age limits, I wouldn’t recommend this app for anyone under 12, because it does have cursing, and content that is not appropriate for younger audiences, however, if it is a parent managed account, parents are able to control what their child watches, what their child posts, they can make the account private, so that only friends can see their posts, and they can even block curse words. If you are thinking about getting tiktok, whether you are a kid, teen, or parent, just do it, and if you don’t like what you see, you can always take it off.',\n",

Now with most other platforms there is more choice in what you watch and consume but on TikTok there’s no filter, you watch what it points in front of you. And the vast majority of the creators, or should I say people who have posted some on TikTok, have no intentions of creating a actual good video. They are there to post something and get views. More then less the videos on TikTok are just to waist your time and try to pander to their audience and not make a good or worthwhile video. With that being said this goes nothing against the TikTok platform, I think TikTok was a great idea yet the publicity of it made it a place for people to search for stardom in their own way, since the bases of the TikTok platform can promote this single video that is bad quality with no reason to exist to million of views and likes. Now also TikTok is extremely addicting to a point where it is unhealthy. It’s strategy is for you when you are bored to open up and watch 1 or 2 videos but then you go down a long route of watching hundreds of videos and you spend hours of your life. My advice.

The next thing is I only ever see people with 1.5k or more likes on my For You Page, and I would appreciate it very much if it were easier for smaller accounts to get views, because most of the time the smaller accounts work just as hard as the larger ones. The last thing is about the comments. I wish people couldn’t limit the comment section to only ONE person. I understand if it is limited where only friends can comment or if nobody could comment, but I feel like limiting the comment section to only one person could make people feel not welcome and it is a big waste of a comment section.

There are cool trends to follow, fun hacks, DIYS, cooking/baking, technology, dance, etc. It has taught me a lot of very useful things, and has brought a lot of joy and entertainment.

Second of all, it takes up your battery very quickly. Third of all, it is very distracting and not so good to be on all day. Fourth of all, it is not included on the App Store for MacBooks which is frustrating because I need it considering my phone might break and I like to post daily or once every two days. Fifth of all there’s quite a bit of inappropriate content around the app, and Finally, there’s a ton of negativity circulating on the app. Which is shocking considering we are all isolated during a worldwide pandemic when we all need a lot of love and support. One thing I do like though is the other side of the people who stand up against the horrendous hate and negativity, and trust me I’ve seen horrendous things.

Tiktok forced minors to go private for our “safety”, Tiktok if you cared for our safety you would’ve banned the adults that were showing off their private parts, let me say that again adults showing their privates. Adults also turned the app 18+ this app was designed for kids. Not adults, I’m not saying if your an adult you can’t have the app, but please remember there are children on the app. I’ve seen four year olds on there, please be mindful of this. Even with your “warning 18+” they are children filled with curiosity meaning that they will disregard that warning. I’ve seen 7-11 kids post “thirst traps” and comment on “thirst traps” I find this disgusting. That’s the parents fault but it’s also the reporting system because I’ve seen countless posts stay up after 10 people said they reported it.

At first it was called musically ! I had at least 400 followers. And then TikTok was made! And I started watching people’s videos and I started making some of my own! I started to gain a lot of followers and I just loved doing TikToks it made me happy! I started to gain more when I got pregnant and having so many people follow my journey.... it was amazing to have so many people watch my belly grow and seeing my baby grow. It’s really touching ! I would love if this app stayed because we need it and we love having all this fun. I love all the TikTokers and it’s fun seeing them all make you cool dances for us to do. So I’m hoping this app stays because there’s a lot of us that want this app to stay for ever.... there’s just a bunch of memories on this app. We can’t take it away from them. And I would be so sad if all my videos and all our hard work went to waste! I have too many h videos of me and my belly growing and just watching all my viedos. And looking back. And see where I got here. So please don’t take away this app. We love it too much(:',\n",

Like, come on! I’m so frustrated about this. My account is being slowly deleted and I’m just standing by and watching my hard work, and effort go to waste. I really did enjoy this app and creating videos, but I can’t do so and keep going if I don’t have an account to proceed with. I had at least 920 something tik toks and now I’m up to 299, including loosing my hearts at which I had 6,200 something as well. Now I’m at 2,446 or around there last time I checked. This problem needs to be addressed cause I’m sick of it all ready want to have my account back to the way it was. I’ve seen other people talk about there friends being old enough to have the app and have their accounts deleted anyways. So if my account gets deleted for good I’m not gonna make another one and watch that one get deleted as well. I went to check if my old account was there and that one was gone too.

Before I forget I have one suggestion if it’s possible in one of your updates, When we are watching a video, is it possible to turn the phone sideways and the video does as well.

The recent generation also was the attention span of a goldfish, and TikTok used it up like water. Their short videos mean nothing. You might find yourself scrolling mindlessly for hours. Nothing about this brings you joy. Every once and a while, you might find a good video. But seconds later, you’ll be scrolling once again. This app isn’t just a “waste of time” it is a life taker. Your days will be gobbled up with the endless amount of videos while you just scroll… scroll… scroll… maybe you’ll even end up liking a video or start following someone. But what does this even really mean? 38k followers? That might make you happy, but how long will this really last? Not to mention some of the people on this app, posting inappropriate content while some how TikTok guild lines skip over it; while other people trying to post things like informational videos get taken down or get given a warning. Why doesn’t TikTok want us to learn about the real world? Do they just expect us to go by their rules like we’re some kind of puppet? Why is TikTok the way it is? Thank you so much for reading, I sure did write a lot. And not to mention, TikTok knows everything. From what you do on any other app, website, or screen, to even your location.

There are so many good things about this app, the selections, the filters, the sounds, and the people you can meet on the app! You always want to keep on the good side of tiktok, with kind people and people who don’t expose their bodies for views. TikTok tries their best to ban people, but most of the time they end up banning the wrong people at the wrong time. TikTok makes multiple mistakes and has let me and others down, despite being my favorite app because of the things you can do on it, there truly is a bad side of TikTok. TikTok tends to have bugs here and there, but one of the bugs they have are so annoying. At a point in time, a few days ago, people couldn’t follow people back. This went on for 2-3 days. It didn’t fix until the next day because you could have 100 people following you, and you didn’t follow back at least 1 of them. Also , what is stupid is that they have sending messages too fast now. It’s annoying, what if it’s my best friend and we only text on tiktok ? Sometimes what TikTok does is actually annoying and makes me want to delete the app. Despite all of this, TikTok is a great app, but could use some improving. Thanks for reading this review, hope you have a great day! Chow !',\n",

I’ve seen reviews that says in inappropriate- which is true in some ways. When you first get TikTok, the app doesn’t know you therefore it shows you extremely random videos. If you keep watching and follow a selection of creators you like, overtime TikTok will get used to you and show more things on your fyp that you want to see. I’ve seen people look through their following list because they hate their fyp, but i don’t see the need for that. obviously it takes time but if ur patient u could get to love ur for you page. I would recommend it but do follow the age recommendation. You could see dangerous/inappropriate stuff that you shouldn’t be exposed to at a young age.

As a “creator”, you can have several viral videos and gain tens of thousands just from those but someone else can post videos that aren’t even there’s and involve no originality or just have a video that involves some kind of fight or drama and gain a hundred thousand in a day just for posting something involving a fight. It’s stupid. Also, the outcasts in society dictate who stays and who goes on this app. People get banned for a having opinions or beliefs contrary to what’s popular. Also, the community guidelines are a joke because of seen one celebrity post nothing but dildos as his content on an app for people 12+ and I reported his videos and they “didn’t break community guidelines”. How is the environment supposed to be safe for everyone if this app allows soft-core porn while limiting content creators who’ve done nothing wrong. It makes 0 sense. That needs to be remedied. Plus it also allows women to bully men without recourse or consequence but men get banned if they say one thing against a woman. It’s hypocrisy at its finest. \\n\\nBesides that, I do love the videos that are funny, wholesome, or creative, and I’ve found a lot of good musicians on this app. I can only give it 3/5 stars because the cons just about even the scales with the pros; they almost tip the scales.

TikTok is unable maintain a consistent enforcement of its community guidelines since they will refuse to take down videos that are in clear violation of community guidelines (for example acts of violence against people and animals, derogatory speech, sexual exploit, etc) or when they do try to ‘enforce’ guidelines, the app takes down videos that do not violate them but are falsely reported by a mass of trolls or go against the app’s ‘agenda’. For the latter case, TikTok does not make an effort to work with creators who have been falsely accused and will shows little regard to have the video restored in most situations. It is quite intolerable that the app allows people to exploit its community guidelines just to harass or silence creators. Also, important social issues/injustices that people try to use their platform to call attention to have been silenced by TikTok through either limiting video’s showing in its algorithm or outright taking down the video with little explanation. Overall, I hope that TikTok is able to do something about this issue soon because for an app that is directed towards all ages, it not only puts people at risk, but displays a cruel injustice that can be simply resolved if the administrators of this app showed any sense of appreciation, decency, and care to the users and creators that make their app popular enough to yield a living and paycheck.',\n",

You talk less with the people you love and know and person, because you’re always obsessed with your videos getting 100+ likes and trying to not get yourself shadow banned.

There is something called a “For You” spot on the top of your screen people might talk about it a lot they might comment on a video saying something like “FYP!!” They are referring to the For You page. If you open the app it will most likely take you to the FYP, on the for you page there is stuff that tiktok thinks you would like to see.( such as funny videos or art videos) if you double tap your screen on a video then that’s how you can like a video, to follow them you can click the plus under their pfp ( profile picture) then you can go to the “Following” page at the top and there you can see the content that the people you post. Like almost all apps you have to make an account I can’t help you sign in but I can tell you that TikTok is a fantastic app so please consider downloading it. Yes I know this was long but thank you for going to read my review.',\n",

Furrys have killed themselves due to this hate. Then the “gamers” are happy about it and saying “one done more two go” it’s a HOBBY I think TikTok should get banned if that’s all it’s about hate all I see. Young furries getting death threats racist people, people who do nothing wrong getting their videos deleted but then TikTok deosnt do ANYTHING about the hate. Yes I’ll be sad if TikTok gets banned but then again I’ll be happy since no more hate racism and sexism ect. Are gone on this app I get there is hate on other apps but this is a problem. I’m only one person but popular creators have been hated on and just leave like the ratata guy left because of hate people JUDGE you for who you are it’s insane... I get this won’t be seen by TikTok but please do something about this you should filter comments and more videos that actually need to get banned I also would love for you to ban “Thatveganteacher” since she’s racist and sorta homophobic she’s also very very rude and doesn’t deserve to be on this app please look into it.',\n",

Lots of people sexualize things, they are rude to other people like maybe body shaming or age shaming, which I completely understand that isn’t in your control but I’m just saying maybe look into that. The app is 12+ but SO SO many kids are on the app. Like, LITTLE kids. You guys need to be a little more aware of who’s joining your app. I cannot number the amount of inappropriate Tiktok I’ve seen. Now I’ve had the app since I was 8. And sadly, it changed me a lot. I’ve seen some things I didn’t need to see, learned about some things I didn’t need to know at the time. I know I’m not the only one, a lot of people say the same thing. Also, I’d like if you’d make it where people with under 1k followers can go live. I’ve had an acc with 5k+ but for whatever reason Tiktok glitched and logged me out, I was never able to log back in. I was super frustrated at the time! It takes time and hard work to even gain 100 followers. Also id like it if there was NOT a text limit. I hope you consider putting a-lot of deep thought into this review pretty soon, thanks!

Like videos can be taken down for no reason, videos that clearly do have a reason to be taken down stay up. For example, I made a video doing a dance and my grandma came in and hugged me. Guess what it got taken down?! I was wearing pajamas and she was wearing a baggy shirt with joggers, so it wasn’t clothing related. Here’s where it’s weird bc that got taken down but videos showing inappropriate content gets to stay up. Another thing is that people get told to kill them selfs on a daily basis but they don’t get in trouble. People get body shamed and bullied on this app but nothing gets done about it. Randomly tiktoks get deleted for absolutely no reason. It’s like tiktok is picking and choosing. It’s not fair to the ones to follow the rules in this app and still get deleted. Also live shouldn’t be debated on how much followers you have. Tiktok is an app that everyone has grown to love but it’s not always a place for everyone bc of all the hate and picking and choosing. I love tiktok and thousands of others do too. So please take what I had to say into thought to make tiktok a place for everyone! \\n\\n                              Thank you. 🙂',\n",

There is an option where you can save your videos private but they fill up your whole feed like on the old musically you could just click on your privates and they would all be together under one thing. One thing that is really making me mad tho is I can’t see how many people have seen my musically when I click on it. It only shows the number of likes but who knows if those are the exact number of likes. The only way you can see how many views is on your main profile page.

Tiktok constantly shadow bans the creators just because haters report the video for total nonsense. They will ban you from Live just because viewers will report you over and over so that the other viewers will go to other people to rank higher.. I bought ads on purpose just to see who they are showing my content to and my content is intended for adults over 21 and they were showing my content to children 13-17 years old and won't give me a refund for the ads or say anything about it showing to them. No wonder I get shadow banned... It is not appropriate for children so yeah it should be reported but I should not be in trouble for it. This is a them problem with their algorithm and not my fault as I am not doing anything wrong. I bought ads and targeted them.. I had 6k views, 1k new followers and 1k likes. After the ad ended, it is now crickets because I'm either shadow banned or they are trying to get me to buy more ads by not giving me viewers in it anymore. All my new videos are not showing on FYP so I'm def shadow banned. The one I did was me dancing to country music fully clothed so it shouldn't be penalized.

Also some people didn’t have to work very hard for their clout, ie Charli D’amelio would just dance and get 100million followers. While other people would be making videos they put their heart and soul into and get none, my point being that it’s algorithm is pretty messed up. There’s also a lot of clickbait videos with the whole “reality shifting” scandal and other various acts that try to get people to believe them even thought it’s completely fake. TikTok didn’t live up to what I thought it would be and it was toxic and messed up with people trying to get views but faking stuff.

I cannot use my wifi while on tiktok, i have to use my LTE data. I have tried everything but it simply will not work. Instead of taking down cosplayers sfx make up videos !that have trigger warnings! Down, take down the bullying accounts and sexual pages that have been up for years. I get that the app is meant for 14+ but there are still underage kids on the app that report videos for no reason, or simply because they got offended by the video that had a warning on it. Instead of taking down the video, actually veiw it, then take it down if it doesn't follow community guide lines. Don't take down a video just because a 6-9 yr. old reported it because their parents said not to watch it. They clearly got angry because their parents got on to them. I'm a cosplayer and am personally sick and tired of the youth on the app that report the lgbtq+, cosplay, gamer, etc. videos just because they did not like it. I hope that tiktok actually takes the time to read the reveiws and try to improve the app. I am very dissapointed in how this community has grown. It went from a fun friend making place to a toxic, full of hatred, unfair community in the matter of seconds. I would comment all my complaints but i do not want to tire out the people that read the reviews on apps.\",\n",

How to do that is you go to your profile, press the three dots in the right corner of the screen, press privacy and tap the little switch next to the words”private acc” and there you go! I definitely recommend to make your child's account private, there are many adults on the app that may be a little to creepy. but over all the app is amazing for you child to learn new things and have a fun time! If you are thinking about getting the app yourself Over the age of 15 I definitely recommend it! Its a-lot of fun and you get to show your creativity by roleplays,coloring videos, edits, and really anything!!!! But tiktok is not the best place to share private information to random strangers on the app,So please stay safe while using the app!! but like i said its a great and fun app! I love it myself!

This makes it harder for you to feel safe in your own home because tiktok is always watching you. And even before you make a video tiktok takes the video and scans your face and they find out who you are and takes that into a data base to secretly watch you which is the creepiest thing I heard all of my life time.

For instance: you would like to show a friend something funny that you watched in a Tik Tok, ...unfortunately it was at the end of the video. So now you have to wait to show them the absolute comedy gold. At first that doesn’t seem so bad does it. Although  something to take in to consideration is that not everybody has time to watch all of a video just to get to the good part. That’s where my idea comes into play. I think that TikTok  should make a feature that includes fast forwarding and reversing the video to the exact point you want it at. \\n   Otherwise I love this app. It is a way to be yourself and be creative in your own way. If you don’t want to do that, it’s also a good to pass time or just have a few laughs. Better yet it’s a way to find common ground with other people who like similar stuff that you do. \\n   I personally like it a lot, but I know some don’t. And that’s ok with me.

Though it seems that there is this giant amount of accounts either called posting in private or some variation of that. On those accounts CHILDREN will post videos of themselves naked and/or doing inappropriate things to themselves on said videos. It is sickening knowing that, that is happening and has been happening for a while on this app. Someone had posted one of those videos on the account to Public which made its way to some peoples for you page. They reported it and it came back saying that nothing wrong was found on the video. A video of a child NAKED. Also reporting those accounts will come back as them not finding anything wrong. Tiktok has continuously been turning a blind eye to this incredibly disgusting ring of adults grooming children to post things that they don’t know will hurt them in the future.

It happens repeatedly until it’s to the point where you’d be better off just making a new account because you’re always post banned. It doesn’t help that it’s incredibly hard to get TikTok’s attention to get these issues fixed, even when you email them it’s obvious that you’re talking to a computer that doesn’t understand what you’re asking. This doesn’t even cover half of everything starting to go wrong with this app, just what I think is the biggest thing. Many creators have already left TikTok due to mainly this issue (shadowban is also a big contributor to people quitting) and many more continue to leave as this app proceeds to ignore these issues.

Honestly, I think you would need just 100 followers to go live on the app. I also don’t like how TikTok puts all famous people on my “For you” page, I would like to give chances to smaller accounts, such as account with at least 30 followers. It would also be nice if there were less ads. When I first open TikTok on my phone, I see an ad about a trend or another app. I’m also scrolling through the For you page and see some random ad that doesn’t need to be on TikTok, although I know some ads promote movies.

It seems that if you’re willing to do the work it pays off. I’ve many many incredible “creator’s” from all around the globe. You can put as little or as much time into as you want. It is important to know the guidelines. I know of other “creators” who lost their entire account. Just an update here. I am still having a difficult time understanding all the rules involved. I have questions and don’t know how to get answers to them. I am being extra cautious and luckily have not been banned. 🤞Still going well.'},\n",

His videos saying it’s ok to r@pe women. Then comment banned me and my account is at risk for saying r@pe is wrong. This is horrific and wrong on so many levels. Do better tictok team. Make the app safe for a change. Disgusted…….. *update*. It appears to me things are improving on the app, and I hope the TT team keeps it up✊🏼*update* I wish til tok would stop suppressing indigenous and people of color voices!! The proof is in the view count!! And banning people for no reason, while allowing hateful hate speech in other ways. I would give 5 stars if they fixed this.*update*. It’s getting better but I still feel there are a lot of changes that tiktok needs to make and stop shadowbanning people who don’t deserve it (like myself) and ban the really horrible people on the app. *. I did nothing wrong and got shadow banned. Yet people can do some awful things on the app and their content has thousands of followers. Would rate 5 stars if I didn’t get shadow banned, because the app is fun and could be a great tool for community. Content creators who repeatedly, and intentionally break so called community guidelines get fame and their videos pushed, while people like me get shadow-banned for being my nerd self.'},\n",

       "  'review': 'The app is very fun to use, especially for cosplay videos being that it is easier to meet other cosplayers on tiktok than ever before. The music is fun, and all in all it is supposed to be a FUN app. However, the app has become littered with 9 year olds that report every video and/or view content that they shouldn’t and that to me is just not okay. The people who work on TikTok seriously need to work more on how they monitor the app. A feature to make your profile only accessible to those 13 and older would be great ( its not like the app started out as a 13+ app or anything, no way, that’s not why there are 7 year olds using it now 🤦🏻\\u200d♀️ ). That way, if a cosplayer wants to make a post with, say, SFX makeup that looks gory someone isn’t gonna come around and report it for no reason, because the profile is 13+. I dunno this feature and a lot of other features could be added to make the app better. Cyber bullying on tiktok is worse than ever right now, and I just hope that the app becomes a safe place to have fun again like it used to be. If you like music, messing with transitions, making new friends rather easily, etc. ... I recommend getting tiktok, if you are easily offended- it probably isn’t the app for you at the moment.'},\n",

At first, they were concerned about what’s on TikTok, but after me having it a few days, and of course, sending them a couple funny animal TikTok’s, they even got it themselves! There is a lot of diversity, and you can learn a lot from it. There is some inappropriate things on there but what I do, is I either scroll past the video or I press the button that says don’t show anything like this to me again. And, once I did that, it worked! Most of my friends have this app and I found some other students from my school and old school on it and connected with them! It’s really fun to make some new friends and connect with old ones. Some cool things I also found out is some hacks with math and that really helped me on my homework! I also found out how to become more organized and know where all of my stuff is! While it can be addictive, there are some posts that remind you that you may be scrolling for too long! But those are upon occasion. What I do, is before I sit down to watch TikTok I set a 15 minute reminder that I have to get up and do some things! I would really recommend this app for 12-16 year olds.'},\n",

For nudity or something like that. It’s nonsense for a kid to be on that. Create an app for kids who are under 18 to have fun but with parental controls. Yes tik tok is supposed to be fun. But why ruin other adults experience for the kids?! Also there should be a rule a strict rule, that says that kids under 18 are required to have parental guideline, and should have to show ID. or have there guardian show ID each time they create an account, or go into a live stream that for 18+ and over. It would make it way easier for everyone in the end to make it better. Adults just want to have fun too. But don’t want to get blamed for having fun in an 18+ only live.

First off, I try to report comments that are so completely violating community standards, such as transphobic comments saying trans people shouldn’t compete in sports because they’re not biologically that gender, and it has been found that it is not violating community standards when it is so clear that it is hateful and degrading!!! And they say this app is for kids! Hah! I’ve never seen such a toxic platform for people in my life! You literally have to fight to actually have tik tok see that it violates community standards, and you have to fight even harder to earn some decent respect! Secondly, there are good sides of tik tok and bad sides of tik tok. What??? Tik tok doesn’t even protect you from harassment from the bad side of tik tok if you ever got onto it (cough cough conservative and confederate and straight tik tok). There have been so many people deleting their accounts because they can’t keep up with all of the hate. Tik tok does nothing to protect their creators and viewers.

Another thing is i like to find random small accounts and like atleast 30 of their videos good or bad, but i can’t do it as often now we have a “limit” on likes and comments (which i think is really dumb). I have one last issue and that is that videos are being deleted for no reason!!! i had a really popular one of mine deleted and it made me super upset even tho it didn’t have anything wrong with it.

Tik Tok is prettty much like all the other social media platforms but BETTER! However it isn’t perfect and I have a few suggestions. First of all I think that the rules on the community guidelines need to chill! After working hard by making videos to go live, I got permanently banned from going live! Also, while I’m on the topic about going live, I think that you should be able to go live no matter the amount of followers you have! It’s really hard to hit 1k and most creators can’t! Another suggestion I have is that there should be a dislike button on videos for 2 reasons, one being that if someone is talking about a political topic that we don’t agree about, I think we should be able to express that! And the second reason is so that creators will know what there followers do or don’t like to watch! Overall TikTok is definitely still really cool and I’m literally on it 24/7 lol! U hope that these suggestions are taken into consideration because I have seen comments on my videos saying these things! But if your wondering if you should download TikTok then it’s a definite YES!

But there should be a few changes such as who can see videos. like when you post a video for only your friends to see, but that should be customizable. We should be able to put who can see our tik tok out of our friends. Kinda like Instagram. Another thing is some times I want to make a video so I save the audio. But I save so many I can’t even find it. There should be multiple folders so when you save them for example, dance sounds, challenges sounds, duet sounds, react sounds, ect. Also I’m not sure if this only happened’s to me but when I’m on my FYP then I want to see my following, when I swipe to the left it automatically refreshes my following page. Witch is annoying because I want to see the videos. I should be able to refresh like on my fyp not automatically do it for me. Also one last thing there should be a bigger limit to your bio and caption. Maybe just like 20 or 30 characters more.

       "  'review': 'TikTok is beyond amazing.. yeah I know TikTok can cause insecurities and other things for people whatever. But TikTok is taking up 20+ gigabytes on my phone. I only have like about 10-15 videos posted and like maybe about 100 or less privates and almost five hundred drafts (but I go through and delete them and it will still stay the same). Kinda annoying. I also haven’t had TikTok that long.. some people have like 1000+ videos posted and has had that account since musically and there’s is only taking 5-7 gigabytes. I’ve had it since February 2019. I think the reason it’s taking up so much storage is because my favorites. I literally used to favorite every video I saw (and like it) about a year ago and once in awhile I’ll unfavorite every vid I see. But there is WAY too much videos (I swear like at least 5,000) so I think it would be awesome if y’all updated it so people can delete stuff easier. Like just hold down and select the once you want to delete (like how you can when you delete photos from your iPhone). Does anyone else agree with me. Oh and I still have much more storage in my phone but overtime TikTok is gonna take all of my storage. It’s already taking up the most storage out of phone.',\n",

Also I love that there is gifting within the app. The is a but however.... There seems to be issues with TT’s reporting process. For example, I had a video reported and taken down because it “violated” TT’s guidelines. I’ve read their guidelines twice and it does not. It also seems that you can report someone for any reason, and even if it is not true, that person can lose their “go live” privileges, or even a temporary ban. There should be an appeal process with TT admins and someone to speak to regarding these issues. Also, while some accounts are getting banned or having features temporarily turned off for no apparent reason, there are bully accounts growing a rapid rates. These accounts depict hate towards veterans, the disabled, age, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, etc. it breaks my heart every time I run into these accounts and see how they mistreat the helpless. SHAME on TikTok for not having a better system to address this. I really hope I can come back and give 5 stars in the future. But for now I’m at 3.',\n",

Like some im saving for a day when i can’t do anything but i still want to give my content to my fans but i log back in and its all gone. So then i have to get back into those cosplays and redo them. While yes, this gives me a chance to fix any mistakes in the previous cosplays i had, i still want to be able to go back later and see the progress i have made. So can you keep the drafts there just maybe put them under a security thing? So that if you have to lock them in case you get hacked or my situation happens nothing will happen to the drafts? \\nMy other problem is that you guys have a set up for notifications from what users we want to see. So i enable the notifications on a few of them but i never get notifications despite seeing their content later. I set up notifs on my gf so i can support her and gets others to support her to but anytime she uploads, i never get a notif. Its usually us chatting later that she asks if ive seen her new tik toks and i am just like shook. \\nSo basically please fix the drafts situation and the notifications please?',\n",

Because it isn’t. You just look dumb and honestly for you to be making sexual content for your 9 year old fans just shows how weird you are. Tiktok used to be so fun until the algorithm messed up and only giving white racist people clout. I’ve been on tiktok for a long time and tbh I am so upset with what has happened to the people on this app. All you see on your for you page is 16 year old boys grinding to the camera and making sexual povs with inappropriate language. Yeah it’s an app for teenagers but what’s stopping kids from being on the app. They can easily lie about their age and be able to make an account. Then there is girls just showing a little skin like maybe an off shoulder shirt and their video gets taken down. But what about the shirtless boys sexualizing the camera referring to sex at parties. Is this what tiktok us now?? Just f boys doing cringe poses to their phone. Tiktok you need to do better😹Chile anyways Stan elite tiktok because we are so unproblematic',\n",

Many people are fat shamed, being called racist names, people part of lgbtq are caked and treated like trash sometimes. If your strate, skinny, and white you have the world and they don’t stop you from doing what you want. But if your not at least 2 of the 3 you will be banned. People who tell others that if there not a vegetarian would die and go to hell but that’s fine they don’t care, while when people call them out and say that’s wrong to do there the one getting in trouble. People who cosplay can’t just dress up in outfits but woman can run naked on beaches. Again TikTok can be a place to meet people but it needs to find out what’s right and what’s wrong. Especially if it’s for people 13 and up. Again TikTok used to be a amazing place but now it’s just a place to get bullied and treated badly if your lgbtq, a cosplayer, if your big, if you do the right thing to help people, have a mental or physical disability, or watch anime.

Second, the privates thing is annoying and u can’t put a video in your privates anymore if I want to duet it. Third, I did some spooky musicallys with the new effects, but they took off this really cool one where everything’s black but it outlines everything and I think that was a really good effect and I was sad when they got rid of it. And lastly, this one isn’t really a big of a deal but Ive started doing redos from my first musicallys but it’s so annoying trying to get back all the way down to the bottom of your account, if u could plz add something to make this easier that would be amazing.

Can you add a gmail verification for age or another way to make it so you can’t just do one mistake then have to wait years till you can have the ability to do stuff. And another note in my opinion after realizing my mistake I looked over my account and saw the limit you guys put on these accounts and they are most unreasonable for the age I have put so as well with the verification problem can you guys put leisure for the older kids are like 12yo allow them to have some leisure but not too much and allow 15yo or 16yo’s to have people allowed to comment on their own videos cause that’s a bit much cause they’re already adults practically or be acting like it by now.

As a puppet entertainer, I’ve been banned for ‘controversial content’ (10 minutes twice), ‘vulgar content’ (24 hours), and even reported as ‘underage streaming’ (1 week)! Mind you, I’m also in the creators fund (verified over 18). 🤬My main complaint is their appeals process, understandably both 10 minute “timeouts” isn’t worth the trouble... BUT, the week ban appeal was reviewed and reversed on the EIGHTH day, and currently my 24 hour ban is on its 14th hour without reply... Making appeals worthless!  ⭐️Suggestion, TikTok provide a better reason why someone was banned, DM the accused a screenshot or video clip of the violation, along with the highlighted guideline(s) violated. Also note, ‘violators’ will NOT be allowed access to their recorded LIVE, making it pointless...

Why is this ok when I seen someone threatening to kill a black baby and none of the videos are taken down for not violating community guidelines? Community guidelines should apply to everyone and not sensor those who report those things that are in violation.

I’m not sure if it was meant to be like this but it seems that only people who are straight, white, skinny, and do weird “trendy” dances can get on the fyp (for you page). It is also very hard to gain followers because of this. The algorithm tends to really ignore creators that fall into the LGBTQ category, liberal category, cosplay category, anime category, or if you are just a poc who speaks out about the injustices in the world. TikTok algorithm will do something that is called shadow banning to creators if they aren’t “trendy” and since it is very difficult to get on the fyp this happens to a lot of people. There are also things to talk about such as the actual bugs like when TikTok will randomly break for no reason, when you lose followers that didn’t actually unfollow you, and when you don’t get notifications when you should be.

Witch is so kind and it’s not like you are scrolling through videos that are 20 mins long they only let you film 60 sec or a min or 15 sec for songs so yes I highly recommend this!!\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'It’s the most addicting app ever! It’s so much fun making videos and watching other people make funny content. In this app you can express who you are . And it’s different from other social media apps which is 👍. I also enjoy how the videos are short and you don’t spend 30 minutes watching one video and I hate scrolling through random photos on instagram, although I still do. In TikTok you just post videos. I also like that you can choose from many videos that express who you are, for example if your into art you watch art videos. If your into comedy you watch funny videos. My favorite thing about TikTok is the dances, you can learn them(which is fun), post them, make your own, and you might become TikTok famous!!! So yeah this is my favorite app, and I hope 🤞 it lasts forever ♾. The only thing is that sometimes there’s this funny part to the video I went to just go to it, at first I try to rewind or skip ahead but it doesn’t work. What I think TikTok should add is a rewind or skip button. Also, I hate when TikTok says “your scrolling to fast” and doesn’t let you like. Just mind your own business !!'},\n",

But now I’m wondering why would I even bother making videos if no one will appreciate them?! My account is ham_money. I am very upset about this feature of the tik tok mechanism. I think that tik tok she give every account a chance to be on the for you page of different people. And also I think there should be a dislike button regards sending hate comments. Also the reporting problem. Far to many people report accounts for no reason. A lot of my favorite tik tok creators are suspended because of numerous reports that make no sense. I think before you can ever report you should set out a questions and answers, to see if it’s really serious. I have tried to contact tik tok many times and nothing has happened I would very much like a explanation, AND a answer. I would like you to try to fix all of these problems. Thank you. I understand this may be hard and stressful. Sorry about that. Thank you for taking my time to listen. Oh and also don’t send me the same response you send to everyone. I liked through the reviews.

For example a situation involving TikToker “OnlyJayus” (which I will not go in detail about) got her mass back lash and if I am correct even her IP address was leaked. Second thing misinformation is a pretty big problem on TikTok in my opinion sure you have large creators spreading researched facts and information but then you have thousands of smaller ones that spread things that are simply ludicrous and not true but it wouldn’t be a problem if most of or at least a good portion of TikTok actually believes it (mostly kids rarely teens). But to be frank there are simply many other problems on TikTok that I can’t simply cover but overall they’re not much of a problem but show their heads once and a while but overall it’s a good app I’d recommend it if you want to be entertained or start a career in entertainment just try not to get in to hot water or fall for misinformation.'},\n",

I am a creator with over 1.8M followers and I have been posting for over a year now. A issue is whenever I try to report a problem or ask any questions with my account I never get any responses from Tiktok or anyone. I believe it I’m a creator with that large of a following Tiktok should at-least reply to my questions. Another issue is the community guidelines and the Ai or bots used to suppress or shadow an your account and take down your videos. I have videos get taken down by TikTok’s robots and they should never have been taken down in the first place. Also Tiktok has been not allowing me and other users to pin comments. The pinned comments i pin are invisible to other accounts and the whole reason for a pinned comment is so other users can see them at the top of a comment section. I believe Tiktok has the potential to stay and be the best social media platform or any device. We as Tiktok creators just need some more support from the platform since it seems like Tiktok is trying to hurt creators for doing what they love.'},\n",

The user-designed engagement is beneficial for those who seek positive influences to learn and expand their understanding of different cultures as well as personal growth. Their immediate response to requests for assistance is unprecedented compared to alternative social media platforms. While I am technologically challenged due to cognitive disabilities, I find this to be the best platform for ease of use and access and global reach. Kudos to TikTok for developing a means to increase global awareness and relationships among so many cultural dimensions. My only concern is privacy and lack of transparency in the government’s involvement in this platform. The manner in which user information is being collected raises privacy concerns. Additionally intellectual property rights/protection and plagiarism is not addressed anywhere. So while the platform is the most promising to unite and improve social wellness, it is unclear what users are giving up of their citizenship rights to receive the platform benefits.

       "  'review': 'Tik Tok obviously is not a platform for children to be browsing on, so I don\\'t understand what the problem is with a little bit of adult humor. There are way too many people who get offended by little things. For example, I made a video simply following a trend of doing a certain dance aggressively. Out of nowhere, a ton of people started hating in the comments for \"being rude to the creator of the dance\" by doing it aggressively. Then in a week or two, the video was \"under review\" and still has been under review for 4 weeks now. Tik Tok rarely ever responds to reports and also shadowbans way too many good content creators. These content creators are probably the reason a lot of people still use the app, so why shadowban them? They\\'re just helping you expand your platform to multiple types of audiences. Also, the views system must be addressed. I have over 20,000 followers and a lot of my videos maintain a very high like-to-view ratio, yet they don\\'t receive nearly as many views as one would expect that it should get. For smaller accounts, this continues to be an issue. Less views means less exposure, which thus means less followers. Tik Tok also seems to tend to give my less successful videos way too many likes, which have a horrible like:view percentage. These views should instead go to the content that people like more.'},\n",

There are funny videos, sad videos, informative videos, crazy videos, serious videos, and anything you could dream up videos. You never know what you are going to run across. I love it. It's the best media app I've run across, and there are a lot of them. Don't worry about going viral or earning money. I mean it's great if you do, but it's harder than you think and if you worry about it you are going to miss out on a lot of cool stuff. Just relax and enjoy it. You won't be sorry. And don't be intimidated about making videos or about the comments you get. Most people are so kind and if you do run across someone who isn't kind or says not so nice things, you can report them and block them. Tik Tok is what you make it. If you want it to be a fun place and want to make friends and enjoy yourself, then make it fun, make friends and enjoy‼️ I am disabled and don't get out much, and Tik Tok has been so good for me. ❤️ I look forward to watching, interacting and making videos. THANK YOU TIK TOK‼️‼️\",\n",

I wasn’t even given a reason. I feel like a suspension before hand and a reason so I could learn better what not to do. But just to take control like that is not very welcoming to tiktok. I now have lost my desire to even get on and post . It’s like why bother I might lose my account . It’s a very fearful app . Not trustworthy is how I guess I can put it. Night wake up one day and my whole account be erased and not even be able to get it back . I have heard lots of stories like that . Anybody can just report a video and it gets took down for not really violating anything. But nudity pornographic things are OK I’ve also seen lots of really foul language and that’s OK but I had somebody asking for a prayer and that video got took down. Enjoyed it for awhile but might move to clapper . I’m told it’s better . Not sure yet . I will keep this one for my kids and grandkids videos I have stored. If it don’t get banned who knows.',\n",

This has never happened before, so I shrugged it off thinking it was just a glitch. But for some reason, I was on light mode. I did NOT change it to light mode in settings, I always have it as dark mode. I changed it and decided to watch some videos. I saw a video I liked, but when I tried to save it, a “tip” popped up that I have to allow photo access to TikTok in order for me to save it. It was like I had just made a new account. I did what the tip said, and I opened settings to allow photo and camera access. But there was no OPTION TO ALLOW PHOTO AND CAMERA ACESS TO TIKTOK. I LOOKED EVERYWHERE. I tried restarting TikTok but then it continued. Frustrated, I thought something was wrong with my account, so I decided to switch to my other account. However, all my other accounts were gone. I was so scared because I posted content for my followers on my accounts, and I had forgotten my password for the accounts. So, TikTok is not letting me saving or uploading videos, and it won’t let me update the app either! WHAT IS GOING ON??',\n",

Obviously we could just save the videos to our camera rolls but 1. The creator sometimes doesn’t allow you to save the video 2. It takes up LOTS of storage.

Sometimes they take down videos from “violations” when they are fine, but then when I report a scam of “You won a free IPhone just click the link in the description” they say the video has no violations. Maybe I reported it under the wrong violation, but that kind of content needs to be removed. Then I report a fishing bot and they still say there is no violation. This is so frustrating for users who are trying to help them keep the app clean of this kind of content. I probably have too many “false” reports since now it takes only a couple of minutes to tell me of there was no violation on the “click the link and we can start chatting” video that a bit sent me. I understand that it is hard for them to go through all the reports that get submitted each day, but at this point I feel like they may not really care about what gets reported to them. I would send them a strongly worded letter, but what’s the point feels like they would just say ‘We are sorry you feel that way, but just block them and ignore them if it bothers you so much.’',\n",

Only people over 1000 followers get to go live, which I think is ridiculous. Maybe you should give new users around 25-50 followers when they first start so at least they have something.  Secondly,  you need to fix your issue where people randomly get suspended by their lives for getting reported. When someone is reporting you should make it a REQUIREMENT to have evidence and if they don’t have any, their complaint is invalid.  Thirdly, the age limit. It needs to be where people only up to 20-25 should be able to sign up, minus “thebentist” and the other cool, family friendly tik-tokers that everyone loves.  I think this because girls and boys are constantly getting verbally harassed by older people on tiktok, such as the Budday.

Many people post videos of them drinking and will mention in the caption that they are of legal drinking age and that they do not recommend underage drinking, yet will be penalized for it (when many other videos are not). I once posted a video that was inspired by several other videos on the app, which contained short clips of each friend of mine drinking, and then passing the drink to the next person. My video was taken down due to a violation of community guidelines, so I submit an appeal mentioning how everyone in the video was 21. It got put back up but got barely any views, so I reposted it. It got taken down immediately and they did not accept my second appeal? It does not make sense and was not fair considering they accepted my first appeal. I can see that many other people have this problem and I just wonder why they are so strict when some of these videos that violate community guidelines are actually great (and extremely popular) content.',\n",

I only have about 90 followers so if I go live I could possibly get more fans. But since you can’t go live unless you have 1000 fans or more I can’t get more fans from live.  I also have another problem, it’s also about live.  So I was watching a tiktoker on live and I left for about 10 minutes and when I got back on the live ended.  So I just so happen to see a video of her saying “ I’m so sick and tired of people reporting me for being under age when I’m literally 19 years old” That mad me and her both upset.  So you should take off the feature were people can report them for being under age so that the person going live has a far chance to verify that they are not under age.  Like I said tiktok is a great app but when  it comes to going live things need to be fixed.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I love Tik Tok! Just a suggestion, if you can't do this already! Since there's the new 5 emojis on the top when you're commenting, i think it would be a great idea if you could just customize them to whatever you want! Then you could have your favorite emojis right there when you need them. Also, allowing creators to go live who have less than 1000 followers would help so much! I miss back on Musically when you could do that. Next, it would be super helpful if in the middle of filming, if you forget to put the time on 15 seconds/ 60 seconds that you can change it. as well as being able to look up filters when you're filming, and using more than one filter at a time. Another huge suggestion is if it's possible, to make it so you can comment pictures/ customizable stickers. Lastly, and I think I speak on behalf of most of Tik Tok when I say this, STOP MAKING IT SO YOU AUTOMATICALLY UNLIKE VIDEOS/COMMENTS AFTER A MONTH OR SO! It's really frustrating when you go through your favorites and discover that the older videos have been unliked. Other than that, I love this app. I spend probably 8 hours on it a day, so I would say it's one of my favorite apps. Thanks! 💗💗\",\n",

Another complaint I have is going live. Also, the (for loss of better words) “rule” about how you must have a thousand followers to go live. There are small accounts that can’t go live for this reason. What harm will it do if you take that “rule” off? Another thing, the one hundred character limit on comments has to go. I have replied to myself to finish a comment. I am a very opinionated person, and if I have something to say, I will say it, but most of the time it is hard due to this character quantity restriction. Another thing I have yet to be confirmed but is very believable is keeping people who aren’t of ideal beauty standards off of the For You page.

It started to rest on its own and delete my account. Then when I exit out of the app completely it will still do the same but I will or will not have my draft and the changes that I made to my TikTok will be gone so I will have to redo them.

It has a lot of fun videos, and the algorithm is amazingly accurate. Most of the people are kind. Some may argue that TikTok can be unsafe, which is true, but it’s not as bad as you think. You can report and block people, and you can also make your account private so people can’t see the videos you make and they have to request to follow you. You can comment on videos, unless the person who made the video decides to turn off comments. There’s is also an option to privately chat with people, but I’m sure you can turn that off if you want to. If someone says anything uncomfortable, you can always block them too. The reason I give it four stars is mainly just bc of my own opinion. I think that TikTok can be negative, they’ll joke about anything and everything (mainly talking about gen-z) which can be tiring and not very nice if they’re making fun of personalities or looks. TikTok is also very addicting and can ruin your attention span, so do yourself a favor and SET A TIME LIMIT. In conclusion, you should get the app, just please be careful.',\n",

I went from daily and constant use, to having restrain myself to 10 videos at a time as to not lose myself in the app. But then they started editing the algorithm, catering to your interests and likes. This causes you to be completely consumed. It gives children, teenagers, and young adults a platform like never before, finding fame almost instantaneously if you understand how the app works and youre willing to sell your soul. My problem is not with how the app functions; it does its job perfectly. No, my problem is with the creators themselves. This is a Chinese app, there is an entire side of the app we cannot see we are not allowed to see and it begs the question what is on it? Thats also not my problem. Tiktok has demonstrated multiple times that it silences certain creators, and it is constant. Black people have been silenced. In light of recent events and the importance of awareness of the BLACK LIVES MATTER movement in the U.S. and now internationally, TikTok has deleted the hashtag #blacklivesmatter and related tags in an attempt to what I can assume is silence black voices and supporters.

It takes years of study, research, wisdom and daily practice to see the pros and cons.

I would also like to not have a limit because maybe you are trying to explain something to your fans, but not having enough in the caption and also having to take it to the comments. I really think Tik Tok can improve on the caption even though it’s only used to write something very brief, I personally think it can be turned into something where you can write a whole paragraph and not having to take it anywhere else. For example you want to explain why you have been gone for awhile on Tik Tok so you write a whole paragraph and when you post it, it shows a little part of the paragraph to make it look like a caption, and says “read more” in a bold font or is highlighted. But overall I really think Tik Tok is a great place to share your inspiration but just not enough in the caption because some others would like to read or hear your creativity and would like to read a whole paragraph about it (in my opinion).

       "  'review': 'The common idea is that TikTok is for kids. I am here to tell you that is 100% not true. There is a HUGE community of Adults on TikTok, and we are all able to have FUN and express ourselves in a way that can be silly, serious, goofy, or ANYWAY that you want. There is the \"for you\" page that allows you to browse through various broadcasters. To build the type of content you would like to continue seeing, you simply press the heart icon on the right hand side of the page. After a while TikTok will only show you the type of content that interests you based on your previous likes.  If you want to continue to see content from a particular person, simply press the plus sign on the right side of the page. This user will now show up on your \"following\" page ( located on the top left of your TikTok main page). This application can be VERY therapeutic for those of you that would like to create content. It allows you to express yourself in anyway that you want. I recommend this app 100% for boomers, Gen-X, Millennials, and ANYONE else who feels they might be too old for this app!!!',\n",

I was a comic book content creator and on some on my videos I was called a “Stupid kid” people having problems with me for no reasons at all. This caused me to delete the app, while I have some good memories of this app, I have flashbacks and memories about what those people said and now I cannot forget, it’s ruining me. For the people that this is happening to, delete the app immediately because once someone starts harassing you it’s almost impossible to forget well, for me anyway. I can’t even read a comic or look some of my favorite things in the world, DC and marvel, I can’t even look at a character without having some horrid memories of what they said. Long story short, I used to love the app but now. It tore me apart and took some of the best parts of me. I’ve also had to push myself away from comics for a while. Due to this. And not to mention, I have been reading comics for 19 years and people said I’ve never read one due to having a different opinion. Also even ridiculed for liking marvel and dc equally.',\n",

It’s the only app that really promotes such a wide array of content and really tailors content to you. The only drawback I would say is the fact that sometimes it is really hard to have your content put out to other people, as the algorithm seems to be spotty in its ability to recognize content and promote it to a wider audience. This leads to many videos not reaching the amount of people you had hoped for and there is no real way to get it promoted. But this issue is not a big one, as from time to time my content seems to reach a wider audience, and so is the nature of life, you win some you loose some. This app has really benefited so many people as I can see, ranging from influencers to small businesses, and lets people reach a wide audience that many other social media apps do not. Tik tok is the first of its kind in this sort of viral media, and it is truly something special and worthwhile downloading. I would choose no other app over it.',\n",

After downloading and finding that I could only save them to one huge space, it didn’t seem much of a problem. However over time, my saved pocket has gotten very filled, and I can’t seem to find certain ones that I wished to save for later. It just all gets lost and I can’t seem to keep track of everything. I think subcategories of the saved pocket would be a great idea. Make them into different categories and allow us to save the cooking vids to the pocket we want to title cooking or the POV vids to the pocket we title inspiration or POV. Just along those lines, I think the app would improve by so much. Allowing us to categorize our saved videos and keep them organized so we can have a better idea of where we put that one video we wanted to follow the steps on or keep for our bad days. It’d be a great addition and allow us so much more storage and head space !!',\n",

Nowadays though I get on and it’s nothing but skinny girls dancing, trying to lipsink songs they clearly barely know the words to, and I’ve seen a lot of vids of people making fun of cosplayers and stuff like that. I miss the old tik tok, back when it was mainly a platform for cosplayers, or at least that’s what it seemed to me. Don’t get me wrong, I love animal vids and stuff like that, but I mean. It’s starting to seem more and more like Snapchat it and fb stories. Like, it used to be fun and diverse, now it’s more just like; one chick on there does a dance move gains a couple thousand followers then EVERYBODY does that dance move and it’s all you see and then they upload another vid with a different dance and the cycle repeats. I understand there are “trends” but seriously. If this app is just gonna be everyone doing exactly the same thing everyone else is doing than what’s the point of having the app? At that point it just becomes “if you’ve seen one, you’ve seen ‘em all”, ya know?',\n",

I really enjoy making videos and being able to meet loads of other people from around the world :) however I do have some issues with the app and I feel like you could improve them. First and foremost, your customer support should be either a number or email, not support tickets. One time my live got banned for no reason ( I was literally sitting there drinking almond milk for 10 minutes ) and it took 2 weeks to get my livestream back. Also i recently got a new phone because my other one was damaged completely. I also got a new number. Because of this I can’t get into my account whatsoever and I’ve sent about 5 support tickets trying to get my account back and I can’t. I have 170k followers that I have worked so very hard for and I feel that your support ticket system isn’t a sufficient way to communicate back and forth with your users. It’s extremely frustrating to not be able to make videos anymore or do live-streams. Please make a customer service email ASAP or a phone number. I am begging you. It would be so much more efficient.',\n",

Many people are bullying and it’s now getting to the point where I’m wanting to hurt myself. I wish that TikTok would actually listen to reports, instead of saying, “Sorry, there’s nothing wrong with this user”. Then, there’s the part we’re it’s now blowing up your phone, saying, “This persons live” or saying, “You have 12 new notifications”, “This person liked your video”, “This person followed you”, and when it does this, it shows so many notifications, waking me up in the middle of the night when I’m trying to sleep! I’m getting really annoyed with this. One time, I was playing my favorite game, a notification from TikTok turned on, and it immediately logged me out of the game, making me leave my friends game!

However, seeing black creators (I hope using the word black isn’t considered inappropriate on this review like it is on the app itself) being used, not being paid equally, and shadow banned for speaking HISTORICAL truths is why I decided to write this review. It’s disheartening how boldly this app supports racism all while non people of color are taking content from black (oops) I mean, melanated folks content without crediting them. I’ve seen more melanated creators endure more mistreatment from an app that without tik tok dances, no one would know what to do with themselves. I find it interesting the terms “white power” and “white supremacy” can just be typed freely but the term “black success” is flagged as “inappropriate”. We get it. You don’t want black people to be successful unless your hands are dug in them for money. It’s how the country was built anyway. Remember, karma is real and you won’t stay on top forever. MySpace and Vine died off too. Only difference is, Tik Tok only values anyone who isn’t black and those that will lie to appease those with fragile egos.

Please, if you have any way to make it less addicting, do it, my friends, cousins, and older friends literally don’t care about me because of this app. I’m begging. Please find a way to make this AT LEAST A BIT NOT ADDICTING!',\n",

       "  'review': 'TikTok is a pretty good app, you get to view into the lives of many others sometimes, sometimes you get a really, really funny video, but then they’re are the people that get the “hype”. My problem with hype is that, it makes a good amount of verified creators to post the same thing over and over again just to get large amounts of likes to make themselves more viewed on TikTok, so if you like any of videos that could be related to, let’s just say Charli, your gonna get the same dances 3 times in a row with millions of likes on them just because, well it’s Charli, that’s the only reason people like it, but then there is actually funny content that just gets pushed down because it can’t get enough likes to make the person a verified user, so what I think could be better would to add sections after “for you” and “followed”, there should also be comedy or pets, or POV, which yes it’s already in the search area, but I feel it would be better if you could press a few buttons to get to a certain term and just scroll to watch videos of that certain type that isn’t the same song over and over again, but, that’s just my opinion.  Developers do whatever you want with this info',\n",

Now that I’m on my 3rd account, I went back to delete my second (made a new one due to my password not working and not being able to login) and had no problems logging in (uggh). But now that I have 2/3 of the accounts deleted and want to login into my main account, it won’t let me due to “wrong account or password” which then leads me to an email section. So I typed in the two possible emails and it still says that the account is wrong... I can’t use the phone number login because my newest (3rd) account was never set up with it because “phone number already used”.. so I’ve never got to have the full usage of the app through the messaging, which is unfortunate. I hopped onto my computer to try to find a support number and couldn’t find anything except an email for business inquiries... lame. So now I’m stuck without an account and don’t plan on making a new one because I just want to use this current account. In the end, I hope to have my current account, email connected and phone number connected so I can actually use the message section.',\n",

Now you have to click on the musically , click on the box, and after you watch it you have to click out, click exit, and then u can scroll to a different private. 4) so let’s say you saved a sound, you go to ur drafts *take a year to get to the editing* and now you can’t just click on the sound circle you have to delete every single segment you can’t reshoot you have to delete segment anytime, which some privates I love the sound but I have to delete every segment to use it and my privates are actual tries so there’s a lot of transitions, I think you can favorite a sound though to prevent this problem but I have no clue how. But if ur still reading this thank you and I love musically the way it was before the update. Yes the new filters are fun and I still do use the app but if it were my design of the app I would keep the face filters te reg filters and the like “soul, illusion, etc.” filters and then take those from the update and add them to the old musically.

Tik Tok will wait until the problem is way to far out of control to actually do anything about it. The only good things you may see on this app are some of the content creators, and I can’t even guarantee that they won’t be a pedo, or racist, or homophobic.

While this comes in handy getting some of the bad people off the app, it won’t get rid of anyone verified, no matter how big of an issue it is, and will keep bad people who already had a platform on a pedestal. This is also an issue because people will mass report innocent people who had nothing to do with it. Don’t even get me started on the gender and age wars that people seem to need on there.

Next I think that all hate pages should get immediately removed. Some hate pages are not terrible but still are hurtful. But there are other hate pages that say very mean and hateful stuff that can affect other people greatly. I have reported an account countless times and so have my friends. It is still up hurting and affecting people and I just think Tik Tok should be more aware of the people that are just on the app to spread hate. And the very last thing is that more small account should get on the for you page and get more views. For example I have three account and one I get many views and likes and on the other no matter what hashtags I use or what sound I still seam to get 5 likes. I think more small accounts should get attention because most people work just as hard as every other big tik toner and still don’t get the desired likes and views. Please improve these.

It has shown me that what ever I’m going through will soon get better. It’s made me more confident in my body. This app is the reason why I laugh everyday. This app makes me laugh, and smile. I don’t know what I’m going to do if it gets banned. This app has taught me to never be ashamed of your past. It has shown me that it’s ok to cry, that it’s ok to breakdown because it will eventually get better. It has taught me to always smile and to always be happy. This app has shown me that people are going through what I went through and that I’m not alone in the world. It’s the reason why I’m still here. This app has saved so many life's. It has stopped so many people from harming them selves. This app has made people love themselves for who they are. This app has made people love their body’s. And it’s not just the app, it’s the people who use it. So please, please don’t ban it.\",\n",

But there’s just too much drama on tiktok too much hate for tiktokers that didn’t do anything wrong some tiktokers get hate for just one little mistake and some people don’t even accept it, and then other fan pages turn into hate fan pages. Tiktokers are now taking really long breaks because of their hate or just their content...it’s so sad to see some much famous tiktokers or tiktokers to get hate and get hate fan pages to  take long breaks because of the hate they get. Tiktok isn’t normally like that people are just being like this because for tiktokers mistakes. Some people act like hostages in tiktok. I don’t understand why this is happening in one single app tiktok has gotten big for the past year it’s been two years now tiktok is getting shut down. My rate is a 4 because of the hate and because it’s getting shut down and it’s so dang laggy but that doesn’t matter he only thing hat matters is the hate and racist people on their blm matter thank you for reading this bless you 🙏🏼.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Tik Tok is probably my most used app. Mostly because there is lots of comedy and dances you can learn. But one thing I don’t like about it is the fact that they don’t always take down inappropriate videos, but they do take down wholesome videos for no reason. Like on one Tik Toker, she made a video titled “Bible Stories With Liv”. And guess what? It got taken down. When it was literally BIBLW STORIES. Yes I watched it before it got taken down, and it was very funny and about the bible story. But then I will see videos of girls/boys talking about or showing inappropriate things in their videos, and they might get reported dozens of times, but Tik Tok will not take it down. Another example, a girl posted a video of black lives matter, and, you guessed it. That got taken down, too! I just think that they could try harder. But some pros about the app is you can be very creative and inspiring. You can share your talents without having to be afraid. You can sing, act, dance, draw, paint, and so much more. It is so fun and I definitely recommend it. But if Tik Tok is reading this, please take my word about the taken down videos into consideration.  Thanks!',\n",

In the beginning I really did not know what to post, but I found what made me happy. I want to continue doing that. However I’m still not understanding the algorithm. I feel like only those who are gorgeous rich can show off their amazingly wealthy extravagant lives get more views and are who are TikTok famous. I’m just a 42 year old single mother and I just wish my videos were pushed out there more, I don’t think I am near as good as others on this app but I do feel like I could get a good amount if I was to have the exposure. So if you could try to push forward in the algorithm and put those like myself out there. Put it out there first please. I would greatly appreciate it.

And the hate is incredible.i know that there is not much that you guys can do about the hate, but it is becoming a huge problem. People are killing them selfs over an app that is supposed to be fill with positive energy. When we report the comments, they never get taken down, unlike some harmless vids. Please just include the feature that when reports a comment, take the time to read it of just delete it. Another thing is the predators. Like all social media platforms, it has scary people. But could you just supervise the inactive accounts, looks at what they comment, and take peoples reports seriously? This app is really fun and def has its pro’s.

It’s awesome and I love the aesthetic videos that people post! And more videos. All the trends 🤩🤩. But anyways, it’s cool Bc you can watch and make any videos you want; appropriate videos! I recommend this app a lot but you’ll probably get addicted and some not!

It’s bothering me Bc they say periods are disgusting and that a month or hair color changes your personality—like what?! •inappropriate comments! And that’s all the problems. Just a few..heh 😑😑.

I also love the art side of TikTok as well but it should get more recognition. When I say art I meant painting, drawing, digital art, etc. I also feel that they should monitor accounts more. I LEGIT SEE 7 TEAR OLDS ON MY FYP! LIKE PARENTS TAKE YOUR KIDS PHONE AWAY OR TIKTOK BAN THE ACCOUNTS! IT LITERALLY SAYS ON THE APP 12+! I’m not hating but there are a lot of pedophiles/predators who can be watching children’s content which is NOT OK.

However, if you don’t push out videos regularly your content is not going to be put out for anyone to see and that can be bad for content creators. Not only that but TikTok’s new update will suppress even more creators because you can buy viewers and buy followers. The only reason someone would need this feature is if they suddenly start getting suppressed, so what will TikTok do? Start hiding other people’s content. Then they have a reason to use the feature. So the only people you will see on TikTok are those who payed for you to see them. Of course there will be the rare few who don’t but they won’t have much followers or views. Not only that but TikTok is really bad at deciding what content needs a censorship. I’ve seen videos where there was blood, violence, hate, etc. While they were censoring videos that had bright lights, even though they already had warned their viewers. TikTok only cares about the money it’s making, and currently it’s self destructing without realizing it. But at least TikTok helps create awareness of different song artists like Mother Mother.',\n",

I’m not saying it’s not good, just saying ideas :> So, first of all TikTok should allow access to Report Users or anything to do when a user is being mean/offensive. For example, if they post a video about someone’s account that is offensive or rude you should be able to report there user. Second, The private accounts/privacy on TikTok. The private accounts are good but it make them better, you can only pick people you want to look at your TikTok page/account. For example, if you don’t pick someone and they go on your account it will say “This Account Did Not Let You Look At This Page” Or another message. So your friends can only look at your TikToks and follow you if you want.

They might take like, 2 hours making a video and doing their best quality and posting it with tags and all that, yet they still only may get 5 likes and it would take a long time to get more followers and be discovered. Lots of people who are popular on tiktok have it easy because they post a new video and so many people follow them that it instantly goes viral and all those other good videos made by people who haven't had a lot of followers yet get drowned out. That annoys me, but I won't complain too much. It could take years to get popular or could take months. Overall, this is a great app and I love it!

The videos they post to advertise this app for being “upbeat” “a great social experience” and so on. But really, that’s only the surface of TikTok. On TikTok we have people forcing religion, people saying slurs, people talking about all of the worlds issues (and there’s a TON) and so on. Maybe I should also mention the white “alt/emo” girls and the e-boys that put their hair over their eyes and wear bunny hats. But instead of talking about all the bad, (which you could simply take away by holding down and pressing “not interested” on every video you come across till you get the for you page you want) let’s talk about the good:\\nThere is SO MUCH representation for the lgbtq community, people with disabilities and people who are just simply different. Most singers fame comes from TikTok, which shows how much it could have a good or bad impact on a person. And there’s so much representation for poc it’s amazing. But really, this app is a 50/50. Whether your making videos or not. Anyways BYE!',\n",

       "  'review': 'So first I would like to say I really do love the app for many reasons, but there are also many reasons why it is becoming my least favorite app now. One reason being, is that when anyone reports a video, even for no reason at all where it is not breaking community guidelines, the app does not allow it to be visible on your profile and is “under review”. One of mine was supposedly reported even though it did not break any community guidelines (and I read the full rules in fine print for the app) and it has been hidden from my profile to everyone for months. This happens on lives as well, if someone reports it the app automatically makes the live stop, even if it did not break any community guidelines. If someone wants to report a video, the video should be visible until deemed otherwise if it is in fact breaking any rules, then it should be deleted. Many users work hard for their content and they shouldn’t be punished for the small percentage of people who report any random content for whatever pleasure it brings them if it doesn’t break any guidelines. The app should also notify the user if their video was reported and is under review with factual evidence on why it is under review so the user can learn from it for next time, or if it is a mistake, can be resolved. And that is why I am rating it 1 star as of this time.',\n",

So of course, there’s going to people who report my account because they don’t agree with my content. Yet they’ll keep up accounts that go against their “hate speech guidelines.” They had to even make it so that creators couldn’t message underage children and the same underage kids can’t receive comments. Just so people like James Charles and Tony Lopez can’t contact CHILDREN. Both creators are still allowed to have a platform on TikTok and make money off it. It’s sick.

I have so many other reasons for loving TikTok and I know a lot of people would disagree with me and that is perfectly fine because we all have our own opinions, I also understand why lots of people don’t like TikTok I know there can be some bad stuff on it but if you know good from bad then try your best to not look at the bad stuff and you will have a great time on TikTok just like I do. Well I guess that’s all I have to say so if you think you might like TikTok and you don’t have it go ahead and download it, give it a try! If you end up not liking it then just delete it and you don’t ever have to download it again. My opinion is still that it is a really good app and that’s all I have to say about it, well I hope you have a great day, dye!',\n",

I also love making my own videos and actually receiving recognition for them, unlike any other platform where only the people that follow you can see your content. As much as I love this app, there are also frustrating aspects of it. If you ever have a problem on tiktok and send them questions regarding it, don’t expect a response. Tiktok is terrible with responding to issues. My account has recently been blocked from posting for a week because I broke community guidelines, which is fine and I understand that, however - when I got it back after a week, I posted three videos in one day, none of which were a threat to the community guidelines whatsoever, and that same day I got blocked again! I have tried reaching out to them through the apps “report and issue “ section, email, and even Instagram! They have never gotten back to me and my account remains blocked. I take my account seriously as well as I have a good amount of followings. Tiktok, please resolve this issue of removing videos that aren’t inappropriate or blocking accounts that are innocent.',\n",

The producer of the game should make an app similar to TikTok where it’s safe for younger kids to be on. Only kid friendly sounds and such. This way no one on TikTok will be reported for no reason. It could be called TikTok Junior or something. It could have all the same features but only kid friendly sounds and content. Sorry if you don’t agree, but those who are younger and are reporting for no reason are ruining others enjoyment. One of my videos was reported and I don’t cuss, or have any gore on my page.

I am 18 but I accidentally put my age 13..when I wanted to put the year, I scrolled down to what I thought said 18 but was 13, and then pressed submit. I don’t want to make a new account, because of my followers. I do truly hope that TikTok can do something about this. Because now since I am “13” my account is age restricted and I can’t change it back. It won’t let me press the button for “allow everyone to comment on your videos”. It only allows me to press “friends” or “no one” this is actually pretty frustrating. Please fix this, because I know a lot of other people on the app who share the same problem as me.

If this were to happen, my notifications would be spammed all the time. And if it were to stay at 1,000, it might help people feel like they accomplished something.

And a friend, one day, Was watching a show DIY’s video and I was being nosy, ends noticed how awesome the video editing and Content was and how it caught my interest and attention the whole way through the video. My friend asked me if I had an account and I told her no and she said “aw man, you gotta download it and make an account! Just make sure when you do it that you have a WHOLE DAY free! And I looked at her confused and she said, “that’s how long you will be on it once you get on the app because it would capture me.” Lol. And sure enough. You know the rest…. But more then just being sucked into videos, I started making my own content and I found how easy it was to put together an edited video was pretty easy! It’s a great stepping-stone platform and I think that with determination and consistency- it’s ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES.',\n",

Lately I’ve even had videos flagged with no option for an appeal. Not even a specific reason is given for the video being flagged. Just “violates standards” and nothing further. The bullying by kids and adults alike is concerning. People leave awful things in the comments and reporting them comes back saying they didn’t violate standards.  We can’t video reply to defend ourselves without being flagged for bullying.  Meanwhile you have big creators getting verified whose content is based solely on insulting and doxxing other creators. True crime creators give graphic details of crimes yet people can’t talk about their personal trauma without being silenced. They cherry pick who gets “punished” and Who doesn’t. The larger creators can post whatever they want with no repercussions and get paid for it. You can’t even get a nonstandard reply from the support team when entering a ticket. It’s just a generic response that doesn’t even fit the topic.  It’s unfortunate because the app itself is great.',\n",

Furthermore, the app as a whole is incredibly inaccessible. Video editing features are difficult to use. Sounds may not always work. The auto caption feature (which hasn’t even finished its roll out yet) isn’t even accurate and highlights blatant discrimination within the app by censoring words like “asian women” and critiques of white supremacy are consistently bastardized.

You want to know what the best vacuum to buy at a specific price point, TikTok will have a ton of creators that give you a quick rundown on which one they love and why along with a demo of course. Want to learn how to shuffle dance? There are thousands of tutorials to pick from. Want to connect with those on a spiritual journey or learn how to plan a destination wedding? You got it, TikTok will have it! What I love even more is that as TikTok begins to notice my watching preferences, it will select videos based on what I’ve watched and put them in my feed and they do a great job of getting it right!

Months of watching blk/brwn communities being threatened with harm and hate and it being left up. It’s mind boggling. If censorship is necessary then censor across the board. It’s clear that the creators of this app are ok with hate and so much more if it comes from a certain color community. Secondly I have come across videos of older individuals sexualizing younger content creators. As a mother this is totally unacceptable. I have had to warn my friends with teens on this app to be extremely mindful of what is being allowed. I say allowed cause even if such content is flagged it hasn’t been removed. The TikTok community guidelines are biased. Anyone I can tell to delete this application I have told them to. It’s clear where TikTok stands on humane matters by their actions not the words that come out of their mouths or the words they type. It’s totally said because the app I felt had so much positive potential my first month all I did was laugh at the comedy and loved the cooking and fashion creators.

There is bad stuff such as nudity and unapproved showing of it as well from other people.  There is too much of showing off of their body to get 10k likes on a post. It’s so dumb to do this. Not to mention many young kids look at these videos too and they see older teenagers doing it; so they assume it’s the right thing to do so they start doing stuff. It’s influencing the younger kids to do bad things. Also, I am pretty sure that if some parents saw what kids were doing on this app, I garuntee that many parents would be upset with many of the videos posted. Once again tik tok is a great app to socialize and see people around the world and see what they are doing. But the guidelines have slipped away and now kids that are underage of 18 are allowed to post videos of them showing off their body and it bring allowed to be on the for you page. The app needs to shape up a bit before major targets start to notice some of the flaws with it.',\n",

Overall TikTok is a great app so many things to watch, hours upon hours I spend watching TikTok I recommenced downloading. I would want to change the way people are represented because of a simple story. In late 2019 and early 2020 I saw a lot of videos saying that smaller more talented creators weren’t getting the followers\\\\respect they deserve, as I watched more TikTok I found smaller creators that were funny, and talented and I know understand.

They deserve the chance, even if they have -100 fans/followers, that doesn't mean they don't work hard on their Tiktok, they do. And maybe they are proud of them.

It's not always about Charli and the Hype House. It shouldn't be like that.

Community Guidelines, they are so unfair! If I post a video with cuss words it gives me a warning and takes it down. But tiktok guidelines don’t see that there’s women twerking half naked and they’re videos stay up. I saw a guy yesterday who wasnt wearing anything and was just covering his private part with a FOLDED TOWEL. and tiktok keeps that up? Just because it got over 50k likes, it gets to stay up. I’m not famous, but if i get 20 likes i would be proud. So tiktok, please make sure you take down the RIGHT videos. Not to mention, 4 OF MY ACCOUNTS GOT BANNED ON THE SAME WEEK! It started with my private account “for too many community guidelines error” Well im sorry that you don’t have a sense of humour of me making a small little joke (which i put a warning for people who are sensitive about taht topic) I wasn’t even being mean! This was on sunday. And today, 3 of my accounts got banned and i got locked\\nout of 1. If my one remaining account gets banned\\ni’m going to get really mad because i didn’t do anything bad, it was just one account where i did liek 3 bad things but I never harrassed anyone.',\n",

Because tik tok is typically to late to ban them before kids find it. There is many disgusting trends or people on this app and TikTok is almost always too late to ban these things before little kids finding them. Little kids use this app. I know of literal  5 year olds having the app. And Tik tok to be completely honest is NOT a kids app. Many heavy topics are discussed on it or things like that. But there is things on the app that are for kids or just generally entertaining things that kids might watch but that doesn’t mean that they don’t have such easy access to bad things because there is just so much to the point you could see it without even searching Something remotely close to it. What I’m saying is that You TIKTok needs better restrictions,needs to ban bad accounts/videos as soon as possible, and maybe even make the app 13+. (I am also 12 but I just want to say that this app is such easy access to horrible things and even child predators)',\n",

And i can’t use the audio. and i did update the app but its still doing that. Second, is the comment limit. If you comment on a video, like lets say someone is hating on someone’s account, and you want to say something to them. The character comment limit is very short so whenever i want to write a paragraph to someone, i just have to reply to my comment over and over. next thing is going live. You have to have 1,000 followers to go live and thats okay. But the permanent banning is what i’m dealing with. there are some people on the app who report lives for no reason. And then the person who goes live is permanently banned. But thats all i’m struggling with, So far i love tiktok and it’s definitely my go to app. I do recommend if you like to make videos and have a platform! Thank You:)',\n",

I feel like when reporting stuff, you should allow the person reporting a video or someone to explain exactly what they are reporting and why, not just a selecting a choice on why they are reporting. There are many other reasons why one reports a video. I feel like you should create a feature on the app that allows one to explain why they report a video. In addition, there are some users on the app that make accounts solely for the purpose of bullying and they don’t even hide it. They make references to racism, suicide, and stuff like that while laughing and making jokes about them. I have tried reporting  multiple accounts like this, but they never get suspended or banned. I believe that in a case like this...you need to do more in banning these bullies. In my opinion, banning isn’t taking this far. \\n\\nYou need to work on your bullying policy more',\n",

First, when you tag “foryou”, it usually gets you on the “For you” page. Second, I like when you tap your finger and move it around, it makes a lot of cute little hearts.

This has let a lot of people find  hobbies that they want to look into, let them start a career, find a new family, find motivation, etc. For example, I new that I liked dancing but I didn’t want to go to a class and I want to do it at home, because I feel more safe there, but tiktok has dances on there and it helps me have fun, spend time with family trying to teach them it for fun while we are in quarantine.  \\n\\nI can go one for hours on how amazing this app is, however I’ll stop here.\\n                  Thank you for reading.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I LOVE this app and I have been on it since musically but I have a few problems concerning the app and I would like to share them so that you can look into them. First, when I enter my following page I can see a few of my recents. (Keep in mind this is about three to five videos) But then I scroll down and I began to see videos from months ago. I tried to unfollow some people and I thought that might be the problem but I only follow about 80 people and it won’t let me see recent videos. I have asked a few people following me if this happens to them but they say it only happens sometimes to them, and others say all the time! Another problem that I have is that when I post videos sometimes it tells me there is a error and it puts it in my drafts. Right? It sounds normal. But no, when I go to my page the video has in fact posted but it is still in my drafts. I have perfectly fine WiFi and I have tried to see if that was the problem but it wasn’t so, like I said I love this app but it has a few glitches. This app is definitely worth 5 stars. ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆',\n",

Another thing is you should add when someone types a comment there should be a keyword filter just like on your regular account. when someone replies to your comment or something like that you can put a keyword filter on so it’ll tell them like “keyword filter towards this person” or something like that. I recently had an account banned with good work on it and it got banned for no reason and i couldn’t get back into it. Stuff like that highly pisses me off because there are other accounts with BAD violations and don’t even get banned while on the other hand i’m posting fine videos on tiktok and get banned. this is a problem towards me and probably others.',\n",

In most videos when I see that filter there is usually an eggplant, or one drop of water which could mean something that has to do with sexuality. Teens under the age of 18, it should be very restricted for people to see this.

Some of the things are how hard it is to make an account, why they changed user ages 13-15 to private and give them no reach, and the “you are tapping too fast, take a break!” functions. It is very difficult to make a new account and try to transfer that email. You cannot change your age at all, so if you accidentally chose the wrong year it gives a disadvantage in reach. Also, the 13-15 age rule is to protect younger peoples safety but it might danger it. Yes, the intent was clear to protect young people 13–15 but then they will lie about their age, inflicting more harm. Not to notice that the age minimum for this app is 12+. People want to go on here for two things: fun or famous. I personally like both but putting my age as 15 on their has eliminated my opportunity to have videos on the “for you” page and make new, safe, online friends. The “tapping too fast” feature is useless because people will just go onto another social media. In conclusion, Tiktok has many flaws concerning email changes, minor protection and their like feature but otherwise it is my go to social media for being bored and constantly scrolling.'},\n",

       "  'review': 'On a scale of 1-5, I would rate this app a 3. I think it’s a different and creative form of expression for young people. However, it has or can potentially dangerous for youth. The content in most songs is 18+. In my experience, I’ve had to tell youth in 6th grade classes to shut it off because of the explicit content. The app has graphic content. Users can search for people that’s near the. This can pose a danger for young children who may think someone is a trying to be their friend on the app, but it could be a predator. And they can message back and forth. There is a potential for bullying in the comments when people upload their videos. And it just doesn’t seem secure for teen. It would be hard for a parent to monitor because fake accounts can be created. Anymore can message you and follow you on the app as well. So, there are many young people on the app who are posting videos of themselves belly dancing and gyrating and they have thousands of followers and people in the comments saying inappropriate things. Other than the potentials for danger and predatory behavior, I feel that the app is appropriate for adolescents who are trying to find themselves and explore their many gifts and talents.'},\n",

One of the biggest is the spam thing that when you try to like a video, it won’t let you and it says,”You’re tapping too fast, take a break!”. It’s REALLY annoying because I will be liking videos at normal pace, not even spamming, yet it still does that almost every day! Last night it stopped letting me like videos, so I went to bed, woke up, AND IT STILL WOULD NOT LET ME LIKE VIDEOS. After 8 hours! Thus has to be fixed! Another problem is the drafts. When you delete the app it will get rid of app your drafts, and I think that there should be a way to save them. You should also put dates on the drafts, and you should able to search them by sound. Another big thing, please please PLEASE make collections so you can sort your favorite videos, that would be a game changer. You should also have a setting where you can block certain people from seeing your comments on certain videos, cause it can be weird when people you know see your comments. A final thing is that you should be able to search up the people that follow you. You can search your following, so you should be able to search your followers!'},\n",

It’s been rumored that TikTok removes content of POC while others are allowed to post with immunity or contest Under Reviews  with success. When stating reasons why a user feels like their video was removed unfairly, there is no response to them other than, it’s removed or not. There is no human factor. If it’s done by automation then what is the REAL reason? I’ve had ppl do tests and it seems that if your lighting is bright, the app allows it to stay. So if you appear fair-skin, you have a better chance of being seen and the video staying up.\\nSeveral users are in underwear that happened to be White are allowed over 100K views but POC do the exact same video and will be hit with a violation strike/account ban and vice versa.\\n\\nWe, the TikTok Community, knows that the creators of the app favor ppl like Addison Rae, Chase Hudson, & Charli D’Amelio.

Nevertheless, I’d like to address a particular function, very popular, that I think would be very useful: tiktok stories. I know, I know. Almost every app now has it. But it’s just that there are some creators such as flo_silriv that upload amazing content only on tiktok and would like to show the making of of it, the behind the scenes, and stuff like that, to show what happened after they did the video, what they felt or even to tell their followers when they are gonna upload so they can stay tuned. That’s why I think stories, even if they are overused, would be so helpful for creators specially the ones that are starting to grow on tiktok, 'cause that will make them grow faster and easier.

The hate that goes towards big content creators and small content creators. No one deserves hate! Am I right or am I right? Young girls and boys get hated for there body’s or personality’s. Half of the time we don’t even know the person behind the screen in real life. Fan pages are also a big problem on the app. But besides all the negatives, this app is a great experience. it also teaches you life lessons that not everyone in society will be nice to you all the time. this app has funny jokes, admirable creators, and cool dances. I would definitely download this app.  I’ve been on this app since musically and for me it’s always been something I loved doing. Dances are the best part of it. Also, you can learn cool hacks, watch stuff about roblox (if you like Roblox), learn about history, or hear an interesting story, talk about racism and history behind it, etc. this app is totally recommended. thank you.',\n",

She told me she started playing Roblox so I wanted to play with her and let her play good games. She saw a game about Charlie and started playing it, I started to get bored from playing that game with her so I told her “can we play another game instead?” She said yes and we tried to find another game, she found another Charlie and wanted to play it. I said she could but I won’t because she was getting annoying and I would play another game. She ended up leaving and came back the next week. She now told me she would die for Charlie and had every single outfit she wears, I told her ok and ignored her. Now every single time she talks about Charlie I have to ignore her so she can stop.

You’ll be shadow banned. And when there’s no reason for the ban they’ll tell you the video is “under review” and won’t receive any views at all.

I had almost 1000$ that I couldn’t withdrawal because you need to wait 30 days after the end of that month before you can. And my creator fund got banned before The end of that 30 days.

       "  'review': \"so i have been addicted to this app since May 2019 and i just think it's a wonderful app but i have a few suggestions, if thats ok. first of all, the FREAKIN COMMENT LIMIT!! i am a muslim and a quarter of the tiktok community is Islamaphobic so whenever i see an Islamaphobic post i just want to rant so badly but the comment limit stops me. another suggestion is to have a dislike button on comments, videos and even accounts so that tiktok reccomends less accounts like theirs. i also think that smaller creators (like myself) with 100 to 900 followers should have a better chance to get on the for you page and get more likes on their posts because all of my for you page, everyone has 100k to 1mil followers and it's just unfair. the most likes my post ever got is 60 and most for you page videos have at least 10k likes so i think thats just so unfair. for the next update, can you include at least one of these suggestions? i really love this app but in my opinion, these will make tiktok so much better💕\\n\\n-Maya❤️\",\n",

But yeah I really recommend to download tiktok! But what I suggest is that tiktok shouldn’t delete other people’s accounts for no reason. I had an account that I didn’t show my face and had this really cool mask (I lost it) but what I did is I had 1k on it and I finally got a chance to go live! But when I had 1k on my account it got deleted! I didn’t do anything inappropriate I didn’t even hate on people so why suspend/delete my account? Also, instead of trying to get to 1k just to go live is not fair for the others! Let others go live with 15 followers! So: tiktok please don’t delete other peoples accounts for no reason! And let people go live whenever they want! Even if they have only 15 followers or less! Other than that I really enjoy tiktok! It’s fun and keeps me entertained!',\n",

Just like all social media, you will get hate. However TikTok’s \\nCommunity guidelines will prevent that from happening. I do have some small complaints though. TikTok’s guidelines mess up sometimes. I can suffer consequences such as getting post blocked, getting blocked from updating my profile, or even getting your account permanently banned from the app. These consequences happen even if you did not violate any of the guidelines. TikTok will say that it was a mistake but that does not make up for what it’s blocked me from doing. Another problem is the age you have to be to have TikTok. I believe that it’s up to the parents to decide how old you have to be to have TikTok. I do think that there should be a line somewhere but 13 years old just doesn’t seem right! TikTok is almost completely harmless even for a young child! Thank you for reading. I hope the developers will respond and possibly fix these details!',\n",

Shadowbanning is when TikTok blocks a video on your page but doesn’t tell you it’s been blocked. So, your fans don’t see the video but you do. It’s so irritating. This should never be a form of censorship on any platform, including one with rising popularity. I’ve uploaded so many harmless dancing videos and cosplay videos that have been shadowbanned for no reason.

My accounts have never had violations (aside from maybe 2 unreasonably flagged videos), I’m not under the age limit, I don’t harass people, etc. but one day I came back to all of my TikTok accounts being banned. Even my private account. My TikTok also started glitching and freezing up so I couldn’t do anything on the app, even when I deleted and reinstalled it. I have noticed a pattern in these ban waves: their target is furries, people who dress up in cute animalistic costumes for fun. Many of the furries I followed got banned multiple times for no apparent reason. So, my point is: Be extremely careful on your account if you’re a furry and make a back up or something. TikTok, please read and respond to this. I’m not that mad about the followers I lost, but on my private account I had around 400 drafts that I worked hard on and now theyre gone forever.

Also stop automatically refreshing my following page when i click back from the for you page. I think that’s all for today, but i will add more when i find anything else. \\n\\nHave a good day,\\n\\nFrom someone.',\n",

Also another reason you are selfish is you get these skinny white girls dancing in bathing suits without getting shadow banned, but when a Black Girl tries to feel comfortable in her body and wears a bathing suit you shadowban her because she was not following the rules of Tik Tok. A reason you are unsystematic is because you are a hypocrite. You tell this one part of Tik Tok you must follow these rules and when they break it it’s okay! But when another part of Tik Tok doesn’t even do anything wrong you shadowban them. Tik Tok is racist, selfish, and unsystematic.

The app is also owned by a Chinese company that has little to no respect for your online privacy, and also censors freedom of speech, especially content criticizing the totalitarian Chinese government and its abuse and total disregard of the human rights of its citizens. A fair amount of users also post content that is misleading or outright false, especially when it comes to political matters. This is all on top of the relatively obnoxious and sometimes outright dangerous trends that are started on this app. Some users post entertaining, original, and witty content, but a fair amount also post obnoxious, dangerous, lewd, or otherwise inappropriate content. Yes, this is technically their right to free speech and expressing themselves, but you should ask yourself how much you personally are willing to expose yourself to. Also, if you are a parent, carefully consider what you are willing to expose your children to. Also, I am not a boomer, I’m well within the target demographic of this app and regrettably have also used it and given it a fair shake.

Now the worst thing is that there is a rumor that TikTok is stealing information I think they are being sued for it. Let me repeat that TIKTOK COULD BE STEALING YOUR DATA. People think TikTok is getting into other your apps too this is sick if true and to be safe parents or adults if you think of getting the app for yourself or your kid read the critical comments I don’t want something to happen to you or your child.

I updated the app, restarted the page, and a couple other things. I asked my neighbor if it happened to her, and she said yes. So apparently it’s a pattern. She said she had to wait it out for about a week. I’d like it if this problem didn’t happen. Maybe it’s something with your servers or programming or something, but it’s not me. Other people have experienced this and it is not fun. I’d like this to get fixed, and as for the first thing, I don’t care as much. I still care though.

Yes, they are all still there in your account, even if you delete the app. But the folder of privates was better and easier to use. It was also better when we could edit our privates. Not just leave them. Bring back private messaging to people outside of friends. More people could be the option to make more friends. I noticed that most of the filters were taken away and the ones that stayed were not some of the best ones.  Bing back all the filters. It makes people be able to express their emotions better. Now, my biggest problem is with the gay flag. Why did you change it? You should not take away a flag that many people use to represent them. People shouldn’t be bothered by the gay flag now. It’s 2018. If a person doesn’t like gays, they can just not look at the accounts with people of the lgbtq+ community or leave this app. People can love who they want. And you just taking away the flag that means so much to us hurts. We never get away from hateful people who only view the world from their angle. People can love who they want to.

Whereas before you could scroll freely and see maybe a handful of ads from influencers or content creators collabs, bow there are ads in between videos all across the fyp. Not only are these ads super annoying, but they are also usually from sketchy and low quality brands. To make things worse, you cannot block the businesses accounts or dislike their videos and many brands turn of comments as well. This allows no tik tok users to put any input into their ad experience and leaves me feeling ignored by the app. I also think that having the comments off removes a lot of important aspects of tik tok. Discourse is one of the main functions of the app, so I think it is ridiculous that they want to silence their users to make the advertisers happy. Anyways I used to love the app and used it everyday and now I am very close to deleting it all together. It’s becoming an increasingly toxic place and tik tok has done nothing about it. The app also filtersdifferent identity    labels in the LGBTQIA+ community and has some major problems with representation of all kinds. Tik tok do better',\n",

Unlike Musically, the app explored so much more than just girls singing or dancing to a song. The app explored what other creators had to show. Including the duet feature which blew up a ton gave the opportunity for people to interact or react with the TikTok video they were dueting. I have known about TikTok even before it blew up and downloaded it when it did. I had this app ever since and the possibility of it being taken down in the United States worries me.

Creativity and time is put into these videos, and so is care! You can obviously tell that the team on this app if fantastic. Another con about this app is that there are rumors about China looking through the cameras. I am on the fence about deleting it just for that reason.

I sent support a picture of my driver’s license to show them that I’m of age and they have since asked me to contact support another way and now I haven’t had ANY communication since. And I’m still getting “age restriction” on videos my friends send me. I still can go live with my peers because of this. I’m so angry, because I have a lot of content and followers, so I don’t want to just start all over. It’s all so frustrating. \\n\\nNot to mention it happened AFTER I started speaking out and for BIPOC issues. Go. Figure.',\n",

Copyright violations aren’t ever explained; some make no sense whatsoever. For example, I received a Music copyright violation on a video that did not even have music in it. Makes no sense. Also, many songs are prohibited for their rights, while many others are not. I’ve had one song accepted, and the same song blocked in a different video. Again, it’s confusing. Also, 95% naked girls are allowed, but a single gunshot without harm is NOT? Also, when a video is posted and accepted, why does that change AFTER I’ve received likes and views? For example, I had a video get 2,500 likes in a couple of days, and then it was blocked for “sensitive content”. So, I like it, but you can tell it’s an electronically-ran platform. Which is unfair because it hurts the HUMAN user by no fault of their own. I’m enjoying, though. Thank you. Just trying to help you and us.',\n",

Does tictoc utilize various inputs to create your custom feed? Yes, and unlike most of the apps you already have, tictoc is very transparent about this feature. One thing we’ve all learned from the covid madness is that data from our devices is constantly being mined or utilized by various entities, even when you think you’ve ‘turned off’ all permissions. Tic toc is different in that it openly informs users about how they tap into data (as well as your preferences noted while on the app) to create an awesome endless array of content that is truly customizable to the user.  An unexpected feature for me is the access to information and videos that you’ll never see in mainstream media. Only downside of this app is that it’s a bit addicting but they have actually taken steps to remind users that they’ve been watching a while. Great app.',\n",

I feel like this doesn’t need to be on there, as reminders from tik tok already pop up to say to take a break, videos are much more compelling. Restricting our abilities is annoying, and makes people dislike what the app is doing, they just want to like things. Tapping too fast isn’t a thing, spam liking isn’t entirely a problem, especially when you’re liking multiple people’s content. You restricting this is disallowing many users on tik tok to have the likes they deserve, and to send out likes to show appreciation. I find this unfair and I think I speak for a pretty big group when I say I would like this removed.

       " {'review': 'So I’ve been on this app for a while. I love to post my art and earning  a new follower is delightful but there are some problems. First, when I first got the app I noticed that when you want to go to the comments, it doesn’t automatically pause the video, it just keeps replaying while your looking at the comments which was very frustrating. But finally, you guys fixed it which was great! I didn’t have to pause the video every single time I wanted to look at one comment. That all changed today when TikTok thought it would be “great!” To get rid of the good comment update and go back to replaying it over and over while looking at the comments😡. Secondly, I’ve been making it on the for you page a lot more lately which is nice and I have over a hundred followers now but apparently you can only have 1000 followers or more to go live. Even if I don’t have a lot of followers as some other people, I should still be aloud to go live because I want to be able to talk to my followers and have more fun on this app. Uhg and another thing. TOO MANY BOTS! You guys have planted bots all over the app to trick people! It’s disgusting!!! You really need to fix your app.',\n",

       " {'review': 'First of all, this app is super fun! I have a public account with about 35 fans, but there are many issues and glitches in the way the app works. My first issue is that there is a certain algorithm to the report system, so if people who don’t like a person go through and report that person’s videos, they get taken down almost automatically. Which is unfair to the creator, when the person could have just used the ‘Not Interested’ button. A suggestion on how to make this better is that you could make it so that the ‘Not Interested’ button is more visible, or that when someone reports a video, the staff at TikTok have to watch it and make sure it’s ok. Another issue is that you have to have 1000 fans to go live, and that lives can easily be shadow banned for no reason, causing it to be extremely difficult to interact with their fans. An example of how to fix this would be to make the shadow-banning shorter, and have a moderator on the live at all times.  Thanks for reading! TikTok is a great app, and these were just a few suggestions to make it better. 😁',\n",

Even though I love TikTok you guys are doing amazing but please fix some of these things . Especially since you are banning so many small creators for no reason which is also making big creators lose likes and followers and potentially quit because of how much they’ve dropped.

And the features don’t even come with app updates, they just randomly appear out of nowhere. At first, it was the test to speech, the auto generated captions and 3 Minute videos, now those features have been given to everyone. But what about the 5 minutes videos that some users can upload, and having a makeup option that lets you customize your makeup on camera, or the ability to sort your favorite videos into collections. I had the last one, but when I uninstalled the app and reinstalled, IT GOT REMOVED!!!\\nOf course this might be because TikTok wants to test the features before rolling them out to everyone, but TikTok has a beta application that you can join for free. So why not put those features there. And how about actually telling us what’s new when we update the app instead of just saying, “try our latest and greatest effects”'},\n",

For context, this post is being written two days after a white man killed 8 people ( 6 of them Asian women ) in a killing spree in Atlanta. You’d think users, especially users of color, would want to see more videos regarding the heinous hate crime that happened. Instead, so many people had their For You pages covered with videos of white creators doing irrelevant things and whatever it is they do. TikTok claims to care about minorities on their app but they’re only saying it so that they look good. They did the exact same thing by shadowbanning/removing Black creators videos last month and before that whenever they talked about racism or police brutality. Interestingly enough, the app still put #BlackLivesMatter on their app, all because they’re performative activists who don’t genuinely care about their users or the people on the app unless they look and act a certain way. Tiktok needs to get it together if it’s going to be one of the biggest social media apps in the world right now.'},\n",

No. We don’t want to hear Siri. We want everyone to be able to access our content.

Many creators get shadow banned and don’t show up on the for you page. The people who are shadow banned actually have very interesting talents such as art. I stumbled apon a very talented realistic artist and they spent HOURS on their art, how many likes did they get? 8. Also, during these times, tik tok is taking down videos that involve the black lives matter movement. Other videos that prove valid points are being taken down, but if a man on tik tok starts sexualizing a minor then is stays up. For example a man named Perez Hilton on tik tok has sexualized a teenage girl named Addison Rae. Theirs a bunch more complaints that I can list, but I don’t want to make this boring.'},\n",

First of all, TikTok has shown a pattern of silencing and shadowbanning LGBT and POC users while continuing to promote straight, white people who literally just stand there and act sexually. It’s completely unfair to people who try hard to put out entertaining and original content. My second point is that there needs to be a better way to separate people by age, I know some kids will lie about their age but I feel there should be some sort of system to help block children from finding the explicit content that will sometimes appear on this app. Lastly, I believe this app would be more interesting and appealing if there were some cool personalisation features. Maybe being able to customise a theme for your page or change the colour of the buttons on the app. Definitely not as serious as my other points but still something I’d love to see. Aside from the few negatives I listed and some that I probably don’t know about, I love this app a lot. It’s an easy and simple way to show creativity and inspire others.'},\n",

I like that you can make your account private but it’s still dangerous. 13 - 19 year olds in tight and short crop tops and shorts, teenagers online posting videos of them in bikinis. And it’s very easy to lie about your age, name, and who you are. I recommend making it 17+ or taking down the inappropriate sounds. I’m not Raging like some reviews do. I’m just saying that parents please read this and make sure your child is protected.  I think that the design is cool and the songs are fun to sing along with, but just please be more kid friendly. People can steal a 12 year olds information and find where the live. It’s just dangerous. It’s fun to learn new dances like on “Just Dance” but it’s not fun to have to personally witness scary content. So please be careful.

So many younger kids in like 1st grade comment on people’s vids on how this video was “inappropriate” the age limit should be between 13 and 20 my friends have gotten texts from me random guys saying stuff like I know where you live. Also people’s  videos get taken down for no reason then they have to remake them for them to just get taken down again. Everyone who had a crown before Tiktok had to work up again to get the popular creator sign. And I’ll be going through the for you page liking vids for it to say slow down your typing to fast which that is stupid. People should get to like as fast and slow as they want without seeing a sign on the screen preventing us to like. The lighthouse on tiktok is fine but there are so many people who comment how they want the old flight house back and that’s the same with me.

       "  'review': 'I downloaded musically in the first place to have fun and play around with friends!! Tik tok still allows you to do that but I think musically was and always will be better. I don’t think it’s fair that people with under 1,000 followers can’t go live. You could do that on Musically. My personal opinion about the age limit is that I think it should be 9+. Another thing about the age is my sister who is 9 downloaded Tik Tok and because she is 9 it won’t let her post, it will only save her videos to drafts, she can’t steal other songs from the circle that tells you all the information about the songs and has a shoot button if you want to use that sound, and she can’t follow people and people can’t follow her. I really think if we get Musically back you will gain a lot more people who Musically had and they left because it changed to Tik Tok!! I hope you will take my suggestions and I look forward to future updates.. And remember, this is just my personal opinion and no one has to agree with me but again, it would just be nice to have Musically back in the AppStore!!!!😀😀😀Please take my opinions and suggestions to consideration!!

Almost every single post you click on, no matter what it’s a video of, has a buttload of hate on it. Special needs people are constantly being told to get more chromosomes, seniors are constantly being hated on just for being ON that app. Oh and if anyone dare do anything to the James Charles pallet they’re never going to hear the end of it. Genuinely funny, nice people are getting hate for no reason. It’s just horrible. Definitely not an app for people with low self esteem. Another thing that’s annoying is when you turn notifications on, you get tons of random messages from the app. It’s really annoying when your phone is constantly blowing up with messages for no reason. There is occasional inappropriate content, and a pretty fair amount of swear words. Which is unavoidable for pretty much any social media app out there, so that’s not an issue as long as you’re at least 12+.  Overall the app is pretty fun just to scroll through the feed and make videos on, I just wanted to point out what I think could be worked on.'},\n",

There's also a lot of racist people that call people names an there videos don't get taken down while informative videos on blm and issues in the world are taken down for violating community guidelines. Another thing is, the algorithm is kinda weird, I personally don't care about my likes and views but I have friends that are almost at 1m follows and their videos sometimes get only 100 likes so that's something to consider if you plan to make it big on the app. I'd recommend having a private account if you just want to use it for fun due to the amount of hate and bullying happens. Some of the larger creators on the app are very problematic and don't deserve their platform and their fans are cult like, if you say one bad thing about them prepare to get doxxed and threatened. I could go on and on, but tiktok is fun to use for creative purposes and to make friends take what you will from this.\",\n",

Now here are some cons; the app tends to be super laggy and slow most of the time, you get your live banned when it’s your first time, tik tok unfollows creators that you’ve followed, and lastly, let’s not forgot that most creators have a certain age limit meaning a certain age must be allowed in that persons account, most don’t certainly listen and ban the persons videos and reporting them to guidelines. If your gonna make a app that’s 12 and up and ban older people’s content that’s not sutible for kids then raise the age limit more up. I don’t want more special creators to get banned because of this. Now I know I wrote a lot but if you see this thank you for viewing it.',\n",

It has lots of perverts and there is a concerning amount of swearing on the app. A lot of kids watch Tik Tok and start swearing or doing inappropriate dances. There aren’t always trigger warnings on videos, either. I have seen some people traumatized bc of some Tik Tok with dead kids in it. There are videos of people doing inappropriate dances.

I had videos of memories that I could not lose. But it was all gone and I could not get them backing . So if you’re going to get this app and create an account and never sign out. Please Tik Tok notice this and help me get my account back...',\n",

And even tho what I said before is going to contradict this, tiktok has gotten much more strict for people who just use tiktok to watch videos. Like they’re not at all strict with straight white men whatsoever, especially if they’re “attractive”, but when it comes to any colored person or homosexual or just anyone apart of the lgbtq community, it’s like they make the guidelines way more strict. And even with people who just watch videos, people aged 16-18 have this stupid “age restriction” that restricts them from watching certain videos. Now I know it’s a good thing for younger kids, but it’s completely stupid for those young adults that are 1-2 years away from being 18. Like instead of being strict with us, why don’t you start working on taking down actually offensive content from bigger creators.',\n",

Odd to say, but I've met some fantastic people through the app. I wasn’t expecting that but during a time where we had no social contact with others, I felt connected, creative and happy. I would give the app 5 stars, but their reporting processes need improvement. Currently it seems that initial reports must be monitored by bots because unfortunately if someone doesn’t like you for ANY reason, they can report a video for violating the guidelines- and often it doesn’t. Numerous false reports like this have allowed homophobia and racist accounts to shut down even wholesome accounts all together because mass reporting, and therefore mass “violations,” causes an account to be permanently banned - or your views all get halted for months. I would love to see only creator accounts (more than 10k followers) allowed to report and you’d be identified on who reported, so people had more to lose themselves by reporting and fake troll accounts couldn’t troll (ie not enough followers)\",\n",

Social media is an idea that people who may have a vast set of differences can find similarities in spite of. Similarities that can bring a smile, start a trend, share an idea, invoke a thought to those we may never have the courage to meet on the street. You are not that site. You have used the “idea” of social media to gain a name for yourselves yet you have never had the intention of being social. You stifle the voices and content of young black creators and now you have censored an entire community and those who seek to support said community. You are flawed. You are an issue. You are a misrepresentation of what social media’s intention. It is my greatest wish that every minority conducts a mass exit from your app. All that creativity shouldn’t be culture jacked at your whim. It is my sincere prayer that when that mass exit does happen you’d be left with an unseasoned mess.

However, I have a great suggestion that I think would improve the quality of Tik Tok. Not that it doesn’t get enough success, but I just think this would create more popularity. I strongly believe that their should be a “Republish” button for each Tik Tok created. This way, accounts can republish their all time favorite Tik Toks to their page just like Twitter profiles can “Retweet” their favorite tweets to their page. The Save button is great for private favorites that you want to go back to or love, and the Like button is great to give some love to a Tik Tok that is entertaining. A Republish button would benefit all types of accounts. Meaning, even if an account doesn’t make Tik Toks themselves or isn’t “Tik Tok Famous”, they would still be able to make their account page creative by Republishing their all time favorite Tik Toks!!! This would help the interaction between accounts. Please consider this!!!! It would be fantastic.',\n",

Luckily, the child was saved but is deeply traumatized. To my fellow cosplayer, find another app! There is a trend of popular users bullying cosplayers. TikTok has also made many efforts, including this stitch feature, to push cosplayers from this app. Who is a popular creator, you ask? Any shirtless, ( or wearing just underwear) white male in their late teens and early 20s that makes seductive videos aimed at younger girls.

       "  'review': 'I love TikTok. It really helps me pass the time, and I think it’s something unique from other social media apps. However, there are two things I would like to see changed. \\n1) My main problem is with phone numbers. We should be able to delete our phone number. I got a new phone number recently, and I wanted to delete my old one and add my new one, but I couldn’t because TikTok kept saying that I have to verify my old number first (which I can’t because I don’t have my old number anymore). I really think that adding an option to just DELETE our phone number would be really helpful, because I’ve seen others having this problem as well. \\n2) Another problem is with the number of views. I have a good amount of followers, and I used to get hundreds and even thousands of views, but now I’m lucky if I even get 100 views. My content has stayed the same, but I just stopped getting on the For You page. I’ve seen other creators (both large and small) having this issue as well. \\nThose are my two concerns. Otherwise, it’s a great app!',\n",

Plus, you can add music to the background of your video. But, as there are pros there are cons. A huge con is, Small, TikTokers, almost never get to have their content showed on the for you page, and some of the things that make you go bigger, you aren’t capable of doing, until you already are big. So, please TikTok can you change this? Another big one is, have a tour guid to TikTok! What I mean is I see content that has cool features in it and before they started doing that they weren’t big. But, the problem is, I don’t know how to do it. Also, can you add a feature that allows you to sort through the content you will see? Like, in your account you can have a settings that says that you only want to watch animal vids and baking vids? Or you can only watch content that is clean? Idk. So I would give TikTok a five star, but, they need to make some minor changes. Witch will bring it down to a three. \\n\\nThank you for your time, if you read my LOOOONG review.',\n",

What I’m trying to say is this app has held my number for quite a long time. I’ve repeatedly tried to remove my number from the dms but I does not work. I’m sorry not sorry this is the rate you gotta get. Second of all, you’re still not think of user purposes by banning lives for no reason. Ok you think this isn’t serious but people are getting banned lives because of your foolishness. Check the dang ol reason and evidence before you permanently ban lives. Duh?! Third of all, speaking of lives I strongly think you should not be having 1000” followers just to go live. You know how much sweat and tears people go through to get 1000 and when they go live you ban their live! This gotta be a joke. Change 👏🏽 yo 👏🏽 live 👏🏽 requirements 👏🏽. And read the reports.

       "  'review': 'This app is very addictive and it’s quite fun. I love the filters and how you can make your account private/public. Although there are some things that I wish for the creator of the app to improve. Number one is not being able to go live under 1000 followers. A lot of people on the app have under 1000 followers and I just think it’s unfair for some to go live and some not to. Number two is that you have to add your phone number to send messages to people. Most people have made more than one account and once they made a new account they can’t use their phone number because it was used on their old app that they left/got kicked out of for whatever reason. Number three is there being a limit for likes, follows, and comments. By this I mean how you can’t like multiple videos if you like to fast. Same thing with following, if you follow to many people at a time you would have to wait an hour which I don’t get. And how there’s a character limit on the comments. I understand you wouldn’t want people writing a whole paragraph, but at least put 1,000 characters for the limit. Other than that this app is pretty good!',\n",

So many videos have been taken down because kids do not like videos that adults post. Most of the time, the videos aren’t even inappropriate. One that was taken down was a girl holding her dog....how is that bad enough to be taken down exactly? It seems like the ones running the app jus take down any video that’s reported without even looking at it. But I’ve reported videos that ACTUALLY violate terms and they stay up. Why? .\\nI think a good update would be to add an 18+ update. I don’t mean make the whole app 18+, i mean to have it so that profiles can set an 18+ setting on their page so it only shows their videos to people who have put their birthday in and say they’re 18 or over. That way all ages can use the app and kids aren’t seeing anything inappropriate, and adults can post adult content (no nudity or anything, and without violating terms, obviously. But posts with cursing in it often get taken down). \\nAlso, shadowbanning needs to stop. So many good creators are losing views because the creators allow them to be shadow banned.

Anyways I am going to share my reasons why I like tiktok, reason #1 because u are free to make videos with epic amounts of filters so cover up the face and one filter I love is the dinosaur suit! It’s a good one. Reason #2 because u Can comment on any vid of ur choice if the creator is allowing it with is good because some tiktokers prevent weird people from communicating on TikTok’s videos by turning off comments, amazing app reason #3 because u can go live and u can also invite people to the live and even on live, you can use filters! Amazing except I never went like before it’s just I don’t have the opportunity to for that still an amazing app! That’s why I love tiktok if you love tiktok like 5 stars and write your own review!!

Second minor issue, sometimes I accidentally refresh the feed and lose track of where I am and miss out on videos, I feel the refresh could be handled differently. Finally, and this is a big one, TikTok needs to get their AI under control and start being more consistent with their banning. There are people actually threatening creators and they are not being banned, there are people who are reporting content because they don’t like it and getting creators banned, there is content being reported that TikTok states “violates guidelines” when it does not. TikTok, you’ve got serious work to do. You need to ban creators who put out actual aggressive/misogynistic/rapey content and ban people who repeatedly report content that doesn’t actually violate guidelines!',\n",

It’s difficult to click on the small circle when you are adding videos to your favorites. Maybe in the next update you can do something similar to when you are selecting videos from your camera roll to be in a video, there will be a small circle to click in the upper right hand corner of the video when it is shown in the gallery form, but when you actually open the video itself maybe also have the button bigger so it’s easier to click. Or when you are favoriting videos, have an option that is similar to Instagram where if you hold down the “favorire” button, have the folders you created come up so it’s easier to organize.

The app got ruined because it’s more like a news outlet than a app for short videos. Every video is about women hating men or some race hating the other or some gender hating straight people. This app comes with a love hate relationship because for every 2-3 good videos you see there’s about 5-8 annoying videos. This app has become the most racist problematic apps I’ve ever downloaded. And it’s all because the same people who said they wouldn’t get the app because it’s lame, are the same people who got the app and eventually ruined it.

These costumes take me around 2 weeks to 4 months to make. Recently, I’ve noticed I have only gotten around 3-7 likes per video, and most of these are bots. I don’t know if people just don’t like my content or don’t like because I’m 13, but I have seen so many people(usually the perfect looking boys/girls) just stare into the camera or lipsync to some song and recieve millions of likes. You don’t get likes or get on the foryou page if you aren’t the perfect image of beauty. For cosplayers, we have done millions of strikes just to be noticed by tiktok and still never are seen on the foryou page except for the cosplayers who are over 18, have the perfect body, and have expensive wigs and props. I never see any cosplayers my age on tiktok anymore. I’m not asking tiktok to try to fix society or anything, but please live up to the 13+ warning on the app. If it was really 13+, we would see 13 year olds, right? Thank you for listening to my rant',\n",

I created a lot of memories on there, videos with my kids that I made so they could see one day when they are older, I don’t have a lot of followers but my account is still important to me.

What I speak of is now on a private account but it was once public and the video is still up. Here is the problem, people who spoke about about this were silenced by having their videos removed or having a week ban on their page.

Aside if the app, creators could make and sometimes do, very critical videos including talking about somebody’s race, sexuality, and how their body looks. One issue I have with the app is that when something bad happens, they try to cover everything that happened. In a live, somebody has committed suicide and sat there for 30 minutes dead. All they did was cover it up acting like it did not happen. They people who created this app need to act like something actually happened. People saw what’s going on and all they do is hide everything??? Tiktok needs to be better than this. They need to control their creators too and not let this much negativity go around. Other than that there is some very wholesome and funny content. I definitely would not recommend this for children under 13 because people like to sexualize most of things like dancing or even what they say.

You might see content on there that is pretty disturbing or something that isn’t interesting, but you could just SCROLL past it. This app allows you to create your own videos with various of effects and filters. There are so many TikTok sounds you can use in these videos. There is a variety of different types of content leading from cosplayers, fan pages, dance videos, etc. Again, I strongly urge you to download this app and make your own videos. If you’re uncomfortable with people you don’t know seeing your videos, just simply put your account on private. That way you can control who sees your TikTok page. You can interact with peoples videos by liking, sharing, and following them. In fact, if you’re pretty famous, you earn money from it. Famous people like, Ariana Grande, Heidi Klum, Dream, etc. are on this app. I personally like tikToks that include the DSMP. So go ahead and download the app and start liking tikToks.',\n",

The reporting system in this app is not functional in the slightest even when going specifically into community guidelines and reporting videos that do break the guidelines and TikTok refuses to take these videos down in the app is flooded with constant hate and near naked people. The guidelines and what people can actually do are so different from each other the community guidelines should not be considered fact. I want to add a video targeted to me personally reported and he never went down. I saw a video saying men should go to war and die airport it and somehow it said it was kicking down when I went on a different account to see if the video is still up it was even though airport had said it was deleted.

They take your IP, data from your SIM, your location, everything about your phone, (if you’ve jailbroken it or not, what apps you have, what software, what carrier you use, etc.) your photos, your contacts, geolocation, texts, they collect information from your network and WiFi, and even if you don’t have an account, they can mine their way into another app and take your data from there, all in their privacy policy. If your Instagram account has your name, tiktok does too. your little dumb loser dances are a breeding ground or an attractant for pedophiles. Trump is banning it because it’s spying on you. It says “DaTa Is sTorEd iN thE US” no. It says in their policy “stored in Europe”. They’re lying about that AND that they store their data in china too. (Which is true).

I did report a video that was very suggestive, and obviously they wouldn’t say things that would get the video taken down right away because they know how things go and that there a monitor on these videos, although it is very loose. It said that they would not take it down or do anything about it because of it not going against their guidelines. Even the comments on this video were adults saying that this video made them very uncomfortable.

I saw a tik tok where this girl was looking for prom dresses and recorded a video of her showing the prom dresses. The comment section was picking a prom dress they personally liked. One girl though said “none tbh”. The creator of the video took it the wrong way and thought that she was saying she looked horrible in the prom dresses. The creator did ask for opinion and she gave her opinion. The girl didn’t personally like any dress. The creator then started posting videos of her and basically asking for her followers to attack the girl and make her feel bad about giving her personal opinions.

And then when you post a regular video, it just goes on it like right by the private!!!! WTH this is really annoying. Another thing I don’t like is the drafts. These are weird and I’m confused on why you made these. I liked it when the video failed to post and it just goes on as a private, but now there are drafts and when you post it again, there is still a draft for it. This is really annoying. This keeps me off the app a lot more. I also don’t like on when you comment on someone else’s video and then when you get off of that video and you go back on it, you can’t see your comment.

It connected us from our living rooms in a way that got us moving in place. It let us say, “hey that looks like fun”, “I think I could do something like that”. And let people showcase themselves in their home, and therefore feel more comfortable showcasing themselves more intimately. It connected “old folks”, who otherwise may have only used Facebook, with the younger generations who stay on the cutting edge. After all kids were spending a lot more time with grandma and grandpa in these “pandemic” times as well, for various reasons. Social media at large saved the day. But TikTok did it with style. 😂👍🏾👍🏾🏆🙏🏾',\n",

Just stop messing with the drafts it was good how it was before. Another thing, we can’t screen record drafts anymore? Whoever came up with that idea is obviously a very dumb person. Some people don’t like posting their tik toks and would rather screen record them to post in snapchat. Another thing I wanted to write about concerns the lives. I’m 15 and I like going live all the time, my lives however are always getting banned. You guys may be too old to realize this but a great majority of the tik tok population is under the age of 15, and it gets me so frustrated when I see a bunch of other lives with people doing way worse stuff than me not getting banned. It’s just not fair, instead of focusing on things that are actually bad going on in tik tok you guys are focusing on banning 15 year olds for joking around and going live.',\n",

TikTok should have people who check the videos to see if there is anything inappropriate in them, instead of just paying attention to small things like copying or something. Also, if you go to inbox and go to the message sign, you can freely chat with your followers or friends; please stop this. Think of it. There are a lot of single men or women who would want to be be with somebody, and let’s say a 15 year old girl starts talking with a 54 year old man and they become bf and gf?

First, an individual who is being bashed on the app, if they duet or react to the video to defend themselves, their reaction is commonly taken down and not the original video where the bashing occurs. This silences select people, which is wrong. Secondly, videos that are taken down that violate community guidelines, usually the sound is not taken down with it.

I am 13+ and i have not commented anything bad.

Also i feel there should be more filters similar to Snapchat or Instagram related because those are very popular apps that make you look better in your videos, and it will attract teens to use those filters more in their videos, as one myself i only have ever used one to two filters in my entire time of being on Tik  Tok since 2015  by that time, musically. So it would be highly appreciated if there were more filters and realistic ones! That’s all I’m asking for. Tik Tok is an amazing app and millions of people use it!

TikTok has good content, easy ways to share content with friends, and the FYP algorithm is sometimes scarily accurate to link you to people with the same niche interests. I think TikTok really needs to improve its reporting functions bc there is definitely some sketch and hate speech content being allowed to exist on the app. Otherwise, it's a lot of fun even as someone who doesn't participate in trends or make videos.  \\n\\nOne of my biggest pet peeves is the missing function to copy or follow links from within the TikTok app. For example, if an artist I follow has a link to their store from their profile, I can open the link within TikTok BUT there is no way for me to directly open the link in Chrome/Safari or even to copy the URL to save and open elsewhere. This is very frustrating bc it has led to a lot of dead-end searches and is a lot of extra work to type out and search specific link URL's outside the app. Reallt hope TikTok can update this feature soon.\",\n",

Tik Tok is very addicting and their is a lot of hate spread on videos. There is also some content and sounds on Tik Tok that are not appropriate.\\n However, a child can get a private account that shields them from most of this and they can tell Tik Tok when they are uncomfortable when seeing or hearing something. On the other hand there are also many kind, uplifting and positive videos on Tik Tok.  I believe that if handled appropriately, Tik Tok is a great app to have for a tween-teen kid because of the education and lessons communicated through teachers and news Chanels on this app. Not only this, but Tik Tok can also teach stress reliving technics and help with ones stress. Videos also encourage body positivity, work efficiency, gratefulness, and respect through videos that kids and even adults love. A great way to share experiences and contact friends.',\n",

When I logged out of my old account it signed me into, it logged me out of ALL my accounts including my new ones, and even when I typed the password for my new account, it didn’t work. Are you serious?\\n\\nNot to mention, when I tried to get back onto my main account, it said my instagram account wasn’t linked to my TikTok account, however when I checked, it was clearly attached. Submitting appeals has done nothing for me. The app is very distracting anyway.\\n\\nIf you make an account and grow a big platform, pray that you don’t get logged out. That’s all I have to say.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Edit from my original Review:\\n Although I do give the app 5 stars as far as entertainment purposes I give it -1 stars for politics. Some of my most favorite creators are getting videos banned or censored for NO REASON. Some of my favorite creators have also stopped making TikToks because of this. I feel like TikToks team should work harder at over seeing the reports and making sure that they’re valid before shadow banning or removing content that honestly is completely and utterly obvious that it’s not offensive in any way. Most creators are mindful and will announce a trigger warning before they even start their video.\\n\\nI’m not one to go for the “trendy” TikToks usually just go for comedians and cooking ones so this right here is my guilty pleasure. Great thing about this app is you can customize it to what you want to view. Skip the stuff that doesn’t interest you and just have a great time. Don’t take social media so seriously. We’re all here to have fun.',\n",

But recently I’ve been seeing some of my favorite “popular” creators disappearing off my fyp and don’t know why. The next time I see their videos i realized that they are getting their content taken down, are getting banned, etc. An example of this is that a creator call ittsdark does commentary about his opinions on the things trending around social media. He ended up getting shadow banned not showing up on my fyp even though I like commentary and getting around 5k views on every video he made. The worst part about this entire thing is that i believe he lost over 6 grand because of this shadow banning. Even I had an account that got banned about 2 or 3 years ago. All i did was make stupid videos to the stupid sounds that i would find while watching tiktok. I got banned for “multiple community guideline strikes” i think that one of my friends just spammed reported me because it was a PRIVATE account any only made my vids for friends only. I sent an appeal but never heard back. I believe this is the suppression of a person’s opinion and that the app is honestly rigged.',\n",

The people that post racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, etc. things tend to get millions of views and likes and  face no consequences on the app for hate speech whatsoever, no warnings and no getting banned. If someone speaks out against those videos or this issues surrounding the videos, their video either gets no views because of tiktok’s “algorithm”, or they get their video removed for hate speech. \\n\\nMy bio was erased by tiktok and I was banned from changing it because “I violated multiple community guidelines.” However my bio was just my pronouns, so how have I violated anything? Tiktok also did the same for my second account, which didn’t even have anything in the bio. Tik tok has yet to inform me on what guidelines I broke and on the hate speech I committed. But tiktok lets these transphobic people have “nor/mal” or “super straight” in their bios. There is a huge problem regarding TikTok promoting hateful people and bringing down the people that speak out against it. TikTok needs to change.',\n",

I really enjoyed my time on this app, making videos, watching videos and just sending them to my friends to see their reactions.

The ability that 15 seconds can do to help a person feel, or make them laugh will always stay with me.

TERRIBLE moderation; everyone I follow has had at least one or two videos taken down or have been actively suppressed, or even get live streams cut off for very minor offenses if any at all, whereas some more harmful content I’ve seen stitched at least three times and probably reported a hundred more before ever taken down.  Video editing interface is not the smoothest either and could probably use features like an “undo” button or toggle buttons to make adjusting durations of effects easier especially on longer videos.  And the app is slow to give all of its users new features it rolls out, leaving most users to discover them on accident, whereas most apps/programs would probably include new features in an update that everyone can engage.  I hope Tik Tok sees this because they have much to address before frustrated creators begin to actually leave the app for other platforms.',\n",

Which is weird because some of them aren’t. Another thing is which is perfectly fine but I think we should have more of is time to film, when I want to film a video I’d like the opportunity to do a short video or a long one. Like I don’t know maybe 2 minutes, just a suggestion. Last thing, I notice that this could cause Tiktok to lag or glitch but I just wanna now, why is it only allowing 1,000 followers in order to go live. I understand how it can cause like like ledge but, I feel it small graders can go live they can boost their followers and Tiktok itself can get more money off of gifts.

I also suggest a duets button where you can see all the duets that have been done with that video. Lastly it would be greatly appreciated if you were able to find the video that you saw on the for you page on the persons profile, because I can’t tell you how many times I’ve tried to find a video on a persons page because it was an older video, maybe a button that will take you directly to it(I’m not sure if any of that made sense).

Everyone knows about the following page, so when I updated the app I went onto it and went to my followings and every time I tried to refresh the page it would always take me to the first video I saw when I got onto the following page. Also I follow famous people like David Dobrik, Addison Rae, Zane Hijazi, but when I go onto the following page it ends up only showing Addison Rae’s videos. So, I then got tired of only seeing her videos, so I decided to unfollow to see what would happen. When I unfollowed her I thought I would see David’s and Zane’s videos, but instead it would show me accounts that are “trending.” I then thought to myself why is it doing this because I knew for a fact that I was following people, so why is it that when I unfollow people like Charli D’amelio and Addison Rae it only shows accounts that are trending and not the other people I follow.\\n\\nTik Tok please explain',\n",

It’s almost like as soon as someone hits the report button TickTock automatically takes it down. This needs to be fixed it’s an issue amongst all users who enjoy this app. Especially when I’ve come across some very inappropriate videos performed by the youth and those videos continue to appear on the for you page. I’m not sure how the community guidelines is set up I’m not sure how the reporting is ran but something seriously needs to be done.

Also stealing the soap dispenser . once on my last day before winter break, the trend where people sent shooting threats and bomb threats to schools. I couldn’t go to school because of that. And because of these trends, they cause kids like me to feel unsafe and uncomfortable. And on TikTok, there’s these girls wearing bikinis who’s showing to much skin and that’s fine? But if someone posts an edit it gets banned? And somehow girls/moms doing very inappropriate things are okay? And then there is guys jsut being inappropriate. And your probably thinking “that’s not true” but I used to be one of the kids who got stolen by TikTok and was doing all those weird dances. that’s why I deleted this filthy gross app. Musically and vine was better.

On tiktok, you used to be able to search for video by using keywords and you could even find video that you watched in the last 7 days if you didn’t like the video and the app refreshed. Now you can only search for users, sounds, and hashtags. Most people on tiktok either don’t use hashtags or the tags they used don’t even relate to the video (e.i. using popular hashtags to get more exposure when the video doesn’t relate to the tag). Plus one hashtag could have hundreds of thousands of videos. I feel like it’s made it so much hard to find videos about a specific topic or trend. If an event happens, I can only see the videos that come up on my fyp (which is usually a small amount mixed in with other content) or hope there’s a accurate hashtag that everyone is using (which isn’t likely).

I feel like there should be an option to be able to see every account that is going love at that moment, I’m constantly trying to find lives just for the fun of watching but they never pop up on my fyp and I can never find any now #3 I feel like you should be able to go live without 1K followers because there are people who are more wholesome and sweet who don’t get the chance to go live while people like charli and they hype house can go live and there’s so many people its overwhelming while if your watching a small account you can comment and get it answered because not as many people would be watching.

       "  'review': 'I would recommend to anyone bored in the house lately, and just because it’s an entertaining and enjoyable app! Although.. here are some pros and cons. Pros, there are a lot of funny people and you are able to communicate and enjoy their content. Tik tokers lately have been talking about important events like for instance, the BLM protests. So tik tok is also kinda educational. Cons, just from personal experience this has been a very very hard app to ignore, so I would be careful to ease getting distracted, for example when I do my homework I’ll quickly get on for a break then that break turns into an hour break, obviously that’s my fault, but it’s super addicting so watch out! Haha, anyways another very very very very important con is the app can be very very toxic. Mean and hateful comments, cancel culture also, where mostly it is people who have said the n-word in there past or have done something racist, there’s other reasons some have gotten canceled but mostly about racism. Oh and some videos that can just be plain out disrespectful. Overall, there are some good things to this app but it definitely needs some improvement.'},\n",

Hundreds of people are being shadow banned and having videos taken down because they’re exposing the US government, because they’re Cosplaying, because of no reason. This app was originally a fun little app to make videos on but now it’s turned into a discriminatory app because if you do something that isn’t dancing and you aren’t white you won’t show up on people’s for you pages. If you make a video talking about what the US government is doing it’ll be taken down. There’s an audio making fun of Down syndrome and it “doesn’t violate community guidelines” even though it does. But then when someone makes a video cosplaying a character they get Shadowbanned for “Violating Community Guidelines” but the videos aren’t and they don’t even say which guideline. Another huge problem on the app is that we had to devote a day to POC’s so they can get recognition. That whole day I saw 1! I was on for hours and saw one POC. If you don’t meet their standards, no one will see your video. There are so many other flaws on this app. If you haven’t had TikTok before don’t get it. The content can be funny but the staff can be horrible to creators doing nothing wrong.'},\n",

TikTok takes up 8.12GB!! So why? I have had this next problem for a LONG time and need someone to fix it. When I make a video with a lot of parts to it or really late at night, I try clicking continue to get to the page where you can edit. Then the app crashes and the only option I have is to cancel, or delete the video that was absolutely PERFECT and had many parts to it. It’s not fair because now I can’t post my video because of a problem. And lastly... small accounts don’t get seen, or famous. So let me get this straight, because you are not famous and everyone knows you around the world, you don’t even deserve to be seen? I don’t even have 50 followers but I can’t get famous BECAUSE I cannot actually get seen. So give everyone a chance and make the app so much more successful than it is already!

When you’re adding effects like slo-mo or visual stuff, you have to time it perfectly when you press the button. I’d love it if you could add the feature and then move it along the timeline of the video to place it exactly where you want it. Then you should be able to make the effect longer or shorter by pinching your fingers or some other mechanic like that. The other thing would be when you’re adding the same effect but in different places of the video, the loop for the effect should reset. I did this with one of my videos (adding the same effect in different parts of the video) and I couldn’t time it perfectly and the end of one loop of an effect tagged onto part of the video and made it look like it used the effect twice. It just looked awkward. Either that, or put how long one loop for an effect is. I messed around with trying to see if any of what I just said actually was implemented but I didn’t figure it out.

Editors for example, are not able to display their edits and skills they want to show to other people across the internet. They can work very hard on edits and want to show others their talents and get other people’s opinions on it. However, with this new update, they are not able to feel the joy of getting views and compliments as much as before. TikTok seeing their edits as “low quality content” is in my opinion very disrespectful to their hard work, and I believe TikTok should be a an app open to any video creating content community out there, and all should be able to display their hard work.

TikTok said those videos were NOT in violation, however it is for my account. They were exactly the same. It appears violations are not equally distributed & small content creators are heavily penalized. The other 2 vids, were the mask disagreement from Carmine’s in New York ( without sound) and a disagreement with table flipping from Golden Corral, both videos used from news sources and both still on TikTok today on other accounts. I don’t know who the arbitrator of my account is that makes these decisions, but there is clear bias. \\nI also receive pops ups, at least weakly, when watching videos from Black creators asking if the video is appropriate.

I make simple LEGO videos and I have around 1.7k when I wrote this review. But for some reason I will post a LEGO set review and it will be taken down for “nudity”. I don’t understand and I was shadow-banned for a month because of it. I lost a lot of followers and that was when I was at 300 followers. At this time this app is overwhelmingly politics based. 1/5 videos have politics or something. What’s funny is that I’m not even old enough to vote. \\nNow let’s move on to the positives. This app is very good to grow a large amount in a short time, and you can get famous by doing almost anything. It is very addicting to the point where I’m on 5 hours a day.

I am a blind user of TikTok and I use voiceover it's pretty simple to use. The thing that I would suggest fixing is on voiceover when you want to add a sound to your videos, it's kind of hard to do that then if you don't use it. Sometimes it's frustrating especially if I can't add the sound I want because I either hit the wrong button. Sometimes I will have to turn off voiceover to add some sounds. Another voiceover suggestion would be to fix the tabs at the very bottom, your profile tab, the search tab, and the home tab which is default when you first launch the app. I would also suggest fixing the share button and labeling the options for a voiceover to speak to sharing options when sharing the video because that's also a problem. Other than that, I TikTok is pretty good for me to years. There's all kinds of fun videos to watch, and that's great! My user name is Belcher3.\"},\n",

Another reason I gave it a four star is you have to have 1000 followers to go live. I want to change that and make it to we’re you can go live no matter how many followers you have. But other than that it is a very helpful app, it gives advice and is a good app to spread news on. You always have an opportunity to get famous on there too. There can be hate but the good thing about that is there is a very good defense group on tik tok. So many people comfort and help you go through bad times especially whenever someone brings you down.

While both treated their users unfairly, Tik Tok has taken that and multiplied it. Tik Tok has been getting worse as time goes on. I highly suggest deleting all users that are 11 years of age and under, seeing as this app is 12+. The kids are reporting harmless videos and getting them taken down, the moderators do nothing about this! Videos have been taken down when they have not violated a single guideline. People can’t upload videos with harmless props or SFX, but little children can do inappropriate things for their age, and the video stays up. Tik Tok needs to get their priorities straight and fix this problem. Not to mention if you have a good amount of followers 10k give or take, and your videos get almost no recognition, no likes. Peoples videos don’t get the reach they should have and deserve. Another thing, “popular creators” that shouldn’t even be on this app to begin with, get way more recognition they deserve when their content is nothing but offense garbage.

We can all relate to mental, family, and school issues and anything in between. I honestly think that the older generations are just jealous of us because WE ALL can come together, WE ALL stick up for each other no matter our race, ethnic background and or sexual orientation.

I don’t care where on the screen, but please PLEASE add captions! A lot of the videos people make don’t have any captions because it takes a while to get the text at the right time and also to remember what you said, often taking a good 5 minutes just to add CC. So I think it would be really nice for users to have the option to have provided subtitles that you can turn on and off in the users settings, which would also correspond with the users language choice. This action would be a great help with people who have hearing problems and either can’t hear what the song is saying or what the person on screen is. I personally don’t suffer from any hearing problems but I still would like to supportive of the deaf community.

       " {'review': 'Hey TikTok moderators! I was wondering if you could fix this big video that is still spreading around on the internet. I haven’t downloaded TikTok since the beginning of September because of it. If you know who Jorobe is on TikTok, he discusses how to fix TikTok’s problems or just not kid friendly content. For example; let’s say that a girl was just dancing in her bathing suit and a guy duets her saying ‘it stuck out’ in the caption. And Jorobe duets it and the problem is fixed. Now let’s get to the real point. I don’t know if the video is still spreading but it is a Facebook live of somebody committing no life. And people on TikTok make videos of cute pets and put the stitch effect or green screen video filter into tricking people to watch the whole video. Please TikTok, take all of these videos down. And another one is people comment on videos ‘Look at my profile picture!’ And people will click on their profile seeing the video because they have a video profile picture. Please ban all of these accounts that are doing it! TikTok is supposed to be a friendly place not a traumatizing place. Thank you for reading this TikTok mods.',\n",

Most of those accounts are LGBT+ and/or POC. Care to explain that? You post about how Black Lives Matter, but you give white creators more attention. You also don’t give small accounts much attention at all. What’s up with that? Also, videos often get taken down for “violating community guidelines” even when those videos in fact do not violate any guidelines. Yet you don’t bother taking down videos that actually do violate your guidelines. Also also, sometimes I will be watching a video, and it will have very few, if any, comments/likes. Yet when I go to that creator’s page and select that same video, there are suddenly many more comments and likes. Again, why is that? Going back to my point about videos being taken down without good reason, most if the videos being taken down are LGBTQ+ and/or POC. These videos often speak out of issues happening in our society.

I deleted the app immediately, my information already is out there but no way am I letting it take anymore.

If you have TikTok, have you noticed that there is a section telling you how many likes you have added together from all posts? If you have an account and you delete a video, the amount of likes you have will stay there. For example, if you have 800 likes in total, and you delete a video with 30 likes, it won’t change to 770, it would stay at 800. This doesn’t make sense because if the video is deleted, the amount of likes should be deleted too. Also, when I first downloaded TikTok, when you looked at the videos of people using a certain sound they would have the original sound and then the most popular. I don’t know if this is a recent thing but I’ve noticed in a few sounds, the videos aren’t in order from most liked to least liked.

If I wanted to have a debate I don’t think I would want to go on a kids app lol. Recently the owners of the app themselves have been messing up too. Ppl can report innocent videos they don’t agree with and get it taken down, yet the video could have been some dude shaking his head at a dance to whom he’s dueting. Rather I have reported multiple videos of ppl getting shot and stabbed yet those don’t violate the community guidelines. Please explain why you guys find it okay to have this type of content on your KIDS app 12-18 mainly and you think it’s ok. It’s truly disturbing to see as someone who has been killed and I would appreciate if you yourselves would actually click into the video to see the content if you have gotten a report. This video had 20k likes and still got away with it. This is not the only time this has happened and all I’m saying is you better find a way to fix it before someone knows how to take down your app does.',\n",

Be aware that if you delete something it is gone forever, and removes your drafts if you delete the app. Although the app has many positive outlooks it can be negative at times. You cannot control what pops up on your “for you page”. If you report the negative things then there will be less that pops up. I have seen many people make fun of races and say racial slurs all the time and it needs to be fixed ASAP!!!!!\\nThe app does have some bugs. For example on the“for you page” by giving people time to look at the video. I also recommend that they keep the app running in the background to watch the same video I was on when you leave the app. You can be creative in your own way in just a couple of seconds. Overall the app is a big step for everyone of all ages in this generation. I recommend this app to people who like to be their self and have fun with music.',\n",

The content flow is great there’s a wide variety on new fresh content on the daily- keeping you entertained and on the app for hours. The tiktok dances create good ways to get some type of body movement or even workout going. However there is a lot of teenagers on the app, a.k.a. a lot of drama. Boys are always half naked to get view and likes, so if you have a younger child asking to get it unless they’re mature and you’re okay with them seeing everything. I wouldn’t recommend until they’re 12-13. There’s some suicidal, drinking, and sex things talked about on the app. All in all though it is a pretty good app - and with hate and negativity comes positivity. Is there a lot positivity yes, is there enough goodness no. You have to also think back to our daily world too. Hope this gave you some more a perspective:)',\n",

It was super weird because I wasn't doing anything I wasn't supposed to. It happened to my friends as well. It stopped around August of 2019. It hasn't done it to me since, thank god but TikTok still has its glitches. I personally love TikTok and couldn't live without it. No I'm not famous on TikTok and I never have been, but there's always something there to make me annoyed with it.

I had over 9600 likes and over 1k followers. They ranked it down. The views on my videos went down. I find it really weird that this happened because I understand that people can unfollow and unlike and such, but why the views go down? Another part that angers me is that I post nothing that isn’t appropriate. I don’t post NSFW and even if I did, I’d put a warning (fake gore, fake blood, nsfw, 13+, etc.) so I find it very odd that this happened. I’d like that to be fixed.

When you bored, sad, you can tell eveyone about your feelings and they can help, if there is a bad comment just ignore it or report it if it is that bad.

And some people are mass reporting content of particular creators leading to unnecessary suspensions of lives, being shadowed banned or having the account removed entirely. Certain profiles should definitely be looked at if they are telling someone to kill them selves- spewing racist, bigoted, homophobic, transphobic and targeting those with disabilities or the creators that have children with disabilities.

Since there are already settings on who can direct message the user, and users can block each other, hate speech and inappropriate activity shouldn’t be much of an issue. I think that it is also a good idea to advocate online safety on the app so things like direct messaging can be promoted and used more appropriately. That being said, I completely understand why the restriction exists, but if you guys want to keep it I suggest maybe reducing the limit to 14 yrs instead of 16 yrs, because users that are at least 14 should be able to be responsible with direct messages. If this is an app for teenagers, all teenagers should be able to use the direct messaging. Family pairing and things of that nature should be a choice. Restrictions should not be automatic.

It is more so negatively towards a certain fandom that has been constantly bullied throughout almost the WHOLE app’s history. Yes we all know it, I’m talking about furries. I’m not a furry but this app portrays them as the enemy since most of them are gamers, and this makes people think about doing verbally or even PHYSICALLY bad things to them and it negatively affects their mental mind. This even happens to kids and can lead to a unhealthy mindset and can ruin their future career if they want to draw art that they love. This is really not good for a developing brain, and I want to let all of you furries and gamers that furries are people too. If you don’t like furries or anything about them, then don’t say anything negative about them online! You need to think about possible consequences and reconsider it. But back to the topic, Yes it is a place for creative people to inspire younger ones,but keep in mind it can also do some damage to someone’s brain mentally if they are being bullied online.

       "  'review': 'I love TikTok because it’s kinda a safe place for creators to come share and show others their potential’s of a subject like some people can dance great and others draw really well and others who can’t do things well still can practice and get tips from others like me. I have an animation account and I didn’t know a good drawing style until I found a great drawing style from someone else and I gave them credit. Yea people can steal but they cannot officially own the things because others can find it and find the original and have them reported for them doing wrong. So the video is removed yea if someone doesn’t like a creator they don’t have to follow but if they want to do something like shadow ban them it doesn’t only effect the creator it effects them. So that is why I think TikTok is a great app for creators to come and share their ideas with others.',\n",

It is conditioned to favor the new IPhones which makes for an unpleasant experience for other viewers with different phones and attracts hate to accounts with other phones BECAUSE of the different formatting. I am not a fan of the new update, as where before if you couldn’t read something you could tap and hold the screen wherever needed and the caption would go away and you could read the things you couldn’t see on your own phone. They took that privilege away and made it to where it covers up half of the bottom screen to see the options and you can no longer read what you couldn’t see. Therefore, this attracts more hate due to the unpleasant formatting. I wish that they would change it back so everybody could read and enjoy the app. This also further makes it harder for the deaf or HOH community to enjoy content. Hate the new update. Change it',\n",

I’d love to see this added like where you can put comedy, cats, or any animals and stuff like that. But you can name your albums and can sort your stuff in it. Also, you can have the option to have for albums or no albums. But for all the people who love to keep their things organized and clean and they want this I would really love for this to be added.

However, there still be improvements. I can watch my video views plummet if I go slightly off course in content. Example: I’m passionate about equality and social justice (BLM). I make 5 posts about music getting 250 views. (Low numbers I know. Lol.) Then I make 1 post about my opinion on current events and I watch my next 5 videos about music get only 100 views, if I’m lucky. Over several weeks those views fill out, but the point is I can literally see tik tok punishing me for straying from my main content, (or having an opinion.. not sure which.)\\n\\nSo obviously Tik Tok has some pros and cons. But this app has a user experience that can easily surpass all other social media if Tik Tok keeps its primary focus on listening to creators and making the best possible experience for those creators. Will they do that? I sure hope so. But only time will tell.',\n",

So seeing smaller accounts more than seeing big accounts will not help once I become big, and I like to see videos that are funny, and popular. Small accounts don’t really hold that weight yet, they just post about games or a lot of them are little kids. I think Tiktok is perfect where it is at right now.

I know the FYP is based on an algorithm that shows us videos that YOU think we will enjoy, but another way to show us videos we\\'ll enjoy as well as finding creators we have things in common with is being able to follow hashtags. \\n4. Small creators should be able to go live, just because a creator isn\\'t \"famous\" doesn\\'t mean they shouldn\\'t be able to connect with their followers. \\n5. Expand the limitation of characters when commenting. We can\\'t always message a creator questions or advice, especially if they\\'re famous. The number of times I\\'ve had to reply to myself just to finish what I\\'m saying & it then get lost in a pool of replies of other people is rather frustrating. \\n6. Add a dislike button. This will allow viewers to simply say they don\\'t like the video without it coming across as bullying or being rude, or subjecting the viewer to other\\'s opinions when they comment. It was also give the creator a better look at how well a video is doing because it\\'s hard to see every comment made & properly judge the video.',\n",

If your child decides to watch multiple of those videos then they come up more often on the For You Page. Netflix has a “kids” option so I believe TikTok could as well.\\n2. It would be cool to make a way where videos that correspond with eachother but dont have the same sound could be in a thread of some sort? like Reddit or Twitter. It would be convenient if you could do it in the comments or the share button. Then we could easily access a certain trend. \\n3.

What this means is tick-tock is going to stop putting peoples videos on the for you page in hopes that they will buy views. This will make people very angry because if you were a popular TickTock creator, and your view count starts to go down drastically and you keep getting comments saying OMG why are your video is not on my for you page, you will know that TickTock is behind it and be more likely to delete the app. Tick-tock cares about revenue. They care about money which is no surprise to anyone. All the updates they've made to the app are supposed to be for the happiness of the users on TickTock and the viewers on TickTock but they're just for revenue which again shouldn't come as a surprise to most people. If people are forced to buy views that get TickTock more money, but it makes a user less successful which will make them discouraged and more likely to delete the app. Their new update is literally going to destroy them which shows how Thirsty for attention and money they really are.\",\n",

But my problem with this app lies in the fact that whenever a serious event is happening in the world and people are making informative videos about them in real time, Tiktok picks a side on whichever topic is being talked about and takes down or suppresses videos. I first noticed this when it came to BLM, but I thought it was just the algo being weird, but then it started to suppress videos on AAPI. My final straw was when recently, I’ve been seeing a number of videos concerning what’s going on in Sheikh Jarrah with the Palestinians. Any and every video I’ve seen about Palestine I’ve seen on this app came from either people I follow on the following tab or I have to search them up myself. Not once have I seen any on my FYP. But I have seen a number of IDF supporters. Same with Trump supporters, or just generally racist content. This is the most irresponsible thing I can think of a huge app like Tiktok doing, because there is so much traffic through this app daily. This is just incredibly disappointing, either show everyone’s videos or show no ones.',\n",

All of the discrimination is kept and doesn’t break community guidelines.

       "  'review': \"I meet the tiktok age requirements but since I am under sixteen tiktok feels that they need to take away my video rights along with my joy from posting. The new guideline states that any user under 16 isn't able to directly message their friends or followers, allow their videos to appear on the for you page, allow followers to comment, and much more. I am a creator with almost 13k followers. Communication with my followers/fans is the main reason I do TikTok . Receiving support and motivation really has kept me going in these hard pandemic times. My account has been an outlet for me to talk to others that want to support me in the “aesthetic” community. If you don’t know what that is, it’s where creators like me post vlogs and clips of their day and give routines to their followers. It’s a fun way to document your life:) furthermore, receiving support has really kept me going in life. And not being able to receive this, is heartbreaking. TikTok, if you truly care about the well being of your teenage creators and about providing them with joy, give them back the opportunity to receive the support that they love and that keeps them going.\"},\n",

My biggest wish would be to have a stricter enforcement when it comes to sexual related TikToks , as it has become overly populated by barely dressed women showing all the body parts just like they do on Pornhub and similar sites. As it is open to be used by minors TikTok shall do the outmost to prevent such content on its platform. The other day i have landed on a live show with two man that found each other and were talking of how they would perform sex if they were in the same room . I am not against freedom of speech , but I do want my minor kids protected against such sexual content on this platform until they are old enough. Perhaps it would be beneficial if TikTok would create specific channels that allow sexuality talk but can be only accessible to adults based on proof of id . It would offer protection to kids and a place to post such content for everyone that is creating it.'},\n",

Secondly if your not in the hypehouse or if you dont have over 50 M followers then your prob still un popular so there really is no point to the app. Third, people like charli damelio and Addison rae are treated like gods for what reason dancing, eating, and just laughing in front of the camera, while there are other people working for hours and not getting any recognition for it and maybe a couple hundred likes and thats it.

I know there is a button to do so but I only have 2 social media apps and that’s where most of cache comes from and using the get rid of cache is only getting rid of a little. I’d like to offload the app and then get it again just to get rid of all the cache. Is it still in the App Store bc I won’t do this if , isn’t. 2. Can you delete liked videos? I have a whole ton of liked videos and I would think that would take up storage so is there a way to clear the liked videos section? 3. When I first got the app, I said yes to downloading any tiktoks I make but I don’t want to do that anymore. Is there a way you can turn that feature off? If I can turn it off where is it in settings and what is it labeled? Thank you and have a wonderful day/night!',\n",

       " {'review': \"TikTok is an amazing app. It's the app I use the most, and always keeps me entertained. There isn't much I'd change about it. Though, I have one small suggestion. For earlier IPhone users (IPhone 5-7/8), our phones are rather slow. For example, I have a small account where I post often. Sometimes when I try and post a video, TikTok crashes in the middle of the process. It annoys me because I can never get the video out. My suggestion is; when you go to your home screen, and it asks whether you want to finish editing or quit...I believe it should have the option of saving the unfinished video to drafts. It would make it much easier, not only for me,  but others with this problem. If this is possible to do, please make this feature in the app. Although I would'nt change anything in your already great app, this would be the only thing. Thank you for reading over my review.\",\n",

I miss musically. Musically was WAY more kid friendly and safe. Iv’e heard people are bullying others for their content and this is not okay. I think you should take reports more seriously. Also, some hashtags are inappropriate. And make sure to CANCEL candyken. He used inappropriate things for clout. He pretended to commit suicide. He made fun of eating disabilities. And he uses fake money and fake phones. This is not okay. Tiktok. Iv’e also heard you guys thing the BLM is a trend. This is not a trend.

Like nudity, and porngrahpy which is absolutely disgusting since children still download the app. Especially with all the hate people can give, like saying your ugly or saying your too fat. Tiktok causes more sucide a than anything and has even brought my self esteem down pretty down. If I’ll say so myself. Also the fact that when someone posts a inapproiate picture as a profile pic, they just remove the photo and don’t delete the profile. Which then the person does it again. Also my account was banned for no reason saying that I had made many mistakes. When my tiktok was only a few videos, and they concluded of me dancing no skin showing and my hamster.

I also think that video should be able to be longer it would help make a lot of videos. And I think that one popular filter that has the line that goes across the screen and that make you pause but the real you can do whatever should be aloud in America because a lot of people want to use it.

But when very dirty and inappropriate content, and content that break the rules, gets reported by THOUSANDS-MILLIONS of tiktokers however, they would not remove the content. Most, if not all, the admin are just unfair. I remember back in 2018 when admin would ACTUALLY make mistakes and after people tell them how it didn’t break the rules, or just told them proof, they would un-remove it.

I am not only hoping that you at TikTok will continue to do this in as many ways as possible, but I am also doing whatever I am able to get other users to see the impact of positive interaction and feedback over negative.

I understand if they get a lot of reports and don’t read them at all, but I wish they would try.\\n      One last issue I have is apparently there is this new update or something that when you post a video or share one it brings you too this page trying to get you to explain why, I don’t know if this is jut me or some type of glitch but I hope Tik tok figures it out.\\n       All negatives aside, this app is very addictive and so much fun!

It's opened my eyes to different cultures and ethnicities and lives that I never would've seen had I not gotten this app. The problem is that there's a massive problem with bigots on this app. \\nRapists, Neo-Nazis, Trump Supporters, White Supremacists, racists, Homophobes, Transphobes, Islamaphobes, Abelists, all of those disgusting people have a platform on this app and make it unsafe for normal people. \\nTikTok itself, meaning its moderators and those who make the guideline decisions and staff in general, are bigots too. They regularly shadowban black creators, suppress indigenous accounts so no one can see their stuff, regularly delete tags related to social issues. The BLM and JusticeForGeorge tags were entirely cleared out- a direct attack on free speech. People that talk about these issues get their videos removed, get their accounts flagged and banned during live streams, etc- for doing nothing more than speaking out against hate. \\n\\nIf you want to get this app, I won't stop you. But you should know that despite the cute dances and fun communities that exist on TikTok, you should know that there is a massive problem censorship and bigotry that comes down from the highest levels.\",\n",

Algorithm changes up on how videos are selected i think. Key is to comment on a subject matter that you like from your favorite creator consistently and they’ll generally do the same for you.  Net: Easy tool to learn & use, fun platform and anyone will enjoy if you’re there for fun and laughter.  Extremely easy to post snd comment on videos.

This app is a children's app. And because little children are getting this app and lying about their age so they can go “viral” they now are ruining the app for everyone else.

I’m disappointed in this app. They force people to have private accounts but they don’t ban accounts that belong to child predators, domestic terrorists who helped the incident on January sixth 2021, and people who harass others? And don’t get me started on their community guidelines. Please enlighten me on how videos of people ENCOURAGING racism, blatant homophobia, and hateful actions don’t get removed from the app, but a video of an adult in a swimsuit gets removed. Please also explain the video going around of a man taking his own life.

Although it’s for teenagers some famous people’s parents also go on TikTok to make videos with their kids and just to have fun. You can make your account / profile private or public and different buttons make it so only a certain amount of people can comment or look at your account. If you don’t care who looks at your account then you can make your account public but at one point if you want your account private then you would just have to go to “ TikTok settings “ to do so.

I would love for more people’s content to get seen because they are very good! But only big name creators are having their content pushed out, it’s not fair to smaller creators at all.

But there are some issues with the app. First, when ever i try to have a conversation with the person going live (I’m usually the only one keeping them company and just talking a lot), it keeps telling me that I am posting too much content. It’s not spamming. I don’t think that tik tok should take care of suspending people from lives. I think if someone is being rude or just spamming I think the person going live should be able to kick them out. It should be quick and easy. My second problem is that I can’t see my notifications anymore! I can only see who viewed my profile. It even tells me when someone has liked or commented on my video. It always says “no more” even when I refresh it, check my privacy settings, log out, log back in, and even try to go to the help center to fix it! Please fix these problems. Thank you.',\n",

It says that you have to have 1000 followers to go live and I have 1216 followers. I already know that you have to go to the plus sign in the bottom middle of your screen and scroll past photo templates but to me it’s not showing up. I’ve tried to update my phone and the app but they both don’t need to be updated, I tried deleting tiktok and logging back in and still wouldn’t give me the option to go live. All of my other friends are able to but not me. My last problem that goes for everyone is why do people get banned from live for 6 days from doing nothing?

They get to show what they are about. The thing that I hate, is that people that put hard work into each video barley get likes. And people that don’t even do anything in a video get millions and tons of likes of views. Musically is something that I want to come back, and maybe other people want musically back. I would love to have musically back. There’s this one thing about musically that’s makes it unforgettable. The first app that I knew of that you could make videos and let other people see your videos and write comments about how good your talent is or the video but some comments can be mean or just be disrespectful and disgusted. I hope you could fix the problem and in the comments let them only write respectful things. If I were to choose TikTok or Musically I would choose Musically of course.',\n",

Yet, they allow videos of half naked girls dancing around in underwear & bikinis but MY video was too graphic… they literally have a filter with a black eye & gashed nose, but MY video was too graphic. About a day ago, I reported a video of animal abuse (many others reported the video as well) and TikTok said it didn’t violate the guidelines.

It’s the place to go to cure boredom, watch amazing 1-min videos, or even just go on it when you have nothing else to do. Though TikTok is one of the best apps out there, it has its own flaws. There aren’t many but if I were to make one tiny adjustment, I would make it to where you can fast forward and rewind on a TikTok. Even if it were to only work on a video that’s over 15 seconds. I do realize that not having the ability to fast forward or rewind may be better for the creator, but if you’ve already watched the whole video and just missed one tiny spot, it would be more convenient. Even if you couldn’t  fast forward/rewind until after you’ve watched the whole video, it would be a lot better. Other than this I don’t really have any requests because TikTok has done such a great job with what it does. I think you should definitely download this app.',\n",

The developers want you to be on tik tok all day long. The more you stare at your screen, the more ads you see, the more everyone other than the user benefits. Don’t you realize that you're the product in this scenario. What’s being sold is your time.

I just can’t believe that you guys would do that... Still somehow I still found a way to love the app and still have the love I did for it when I was younger. But when I come back on musically (bc I took a break) I saw everyone had some “new update”. I thought I’d was gonna be sooo cool! So I updated musically. Then when I got back on it...well....um...The format was different and difficult to realize what to do. Then I tried the new affects. It just reminded me of a very lame funimate!!! I did not like it and Was mad I updated it! So I have decided to delete my account,offload it,Or just leave it be and not even bother to never use it again. Even if I do do one of those things.... I think Musically has a special place in my heart... Or it was just one of those apps that everyone hates 😂',\n",
